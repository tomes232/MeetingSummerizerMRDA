me013|what are we doing?|Q|qw|t
me011|i since i've been gone all week i didn't send out a reminder for an agenda.|S|s|t
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah and i'm just|D|fg|fg
me011|do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go?|Q|qr|t
me018|i wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was.|S|s|t
me013|what conference?|Q|qw|bu
fe016|uh i had one question about|D|fg|fg
me011|yeah really.|S|s|aa
me011|it's all a blur?|Q|qy|d
fe016|aren't the u w folks coming this weekend?|Q|qy|rt
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
mn017|no the next.|S|s|ar
mn017|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|next weekend week from|D|s|aa
fe016|next weekend.|S|s|bu
me013|that is right.|S|s|aa
fe016|sorry not not not the days coming up but|D|s|s
me013|the next weekend.|S|s|s
mn017|it's like the|D|%|%
me011|a week from saturday.|S|s|bs
fe016|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|within ten days.|S|s|s
me013|that's when they're coming.|S|s|s
me013|that's correct.|S|s|aa
fe016|so are we do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be|D|fg|fg
me013|no but that would be a good idea.|S|s|ar
fe016|okay.|S|s|bk
mn017|so so the deal is that i can um uh i can be available after uh like ten thirty or something.|S|fg|fg
me013|why don't we|D|s|cs
mn017|i don't know how how early you wanted to|D|s|s
me013|they're not even going to be here until eleven or so.|S|s|s
mn017|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me011|that's good.|S|s|ba
mn017|so|F|h|h
fe016|wait this is on on sunday?|Q|qy|d
me013|because they're flying up that day.|S|s|e
me013|saturday.|S|s|ng
fe016|or saturday?|Q|qrr|qrr
me013|saturday.|S|s|r
mn017|saturday.|S|s|m
fe016|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|well|D|%|%
me013|saturday.|S|s|bu
mn017|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|eurospeech is due on friday.|S|s|s
me011|and then i'm going down to san uh san jose friday night.|S|s|s
me011|so if you know if we start nice and late saturday that's a good thing.|S|s|s
me013|no i mean they're flying up from from|D|s|s
me011|seattle.|S|s|2
me013|down from seattle.|S|s|bsc
me011|they're flying from somewhere to somewhere.|S|s|bs
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|and they'll end up here.|S|s|s
me013|so and also brian kingsbury is actually flying from uh the east coast on that that morning.|S|s|s
fe008|excellent.|S|s|ba
me013|so i i will be i mean he's taking a very early flight.|S|s|s
mn017|oh.|B|b|b
me013|and we do have the time work difference running the right way.|S|s|s
me013|but i still think that there's no way we could start before eleven.|S|s|s
me013|it might end up really being twelve.|S|s|s
me013|so when we get closer we'll find people's plane schedules and let everybody know.|S|s|rt
me013|uh so that's good.|S|fh|fh
me011|but uh yeah maybe an agenda or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea.|S|fg|fg
me013|well we can start gathering those those ideas.|S|s|cs
me013|but then we we should firm it up by next next thursday's meeting.|S|s|co
fe008|will we have time to um to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the i b m transcribers by then?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|or|D|qrr|qrr
me011|oh yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|absolutely.|S|s|aa
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|so have you heard back from brian about that?|Q|qy|rt
me011|chuck.|S|s|s
me018|yes.|S|s|aa
me018|um|F|h|h
me018|he's i i'm sorry i should have forwarded that along.|S|s|fa
me018|uh oh i i think i mentioned at the last meeting.|S|fh|fh
me018|he said that um he talked to them.|S|s|s
me018|and it was fine with the beeps.|S|s|s
me018|they would be that's easy for them to do.|S|s|s
me011|great.|S|s|ba
me011|okay.|B|b|b
me011|so uh oh though thilo isn't here.|S|fh|fh
me011|um but uh|F|fh|fh
me011|i i have the program to insert the beeps.|D|s|s
me011|what i don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps.|S|s|s
me011|but that should be really easy to do.|S|s|s
me011|so do we have a meeting that that's been done with?|Q|qy|rt
me011|that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to i b m and have them try it out.|S|s|e
fe008|he's he's|D|s|s
fe008|he generated um a channel wise presegmented version of a meeting.|S|s|na
fe008|but it was robustness rather than e d u so i guess depends on whether we're willing to use robustness.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|well for this experiment i think we can use pretty much anything.|S|s|s
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me018|this experiment of just|D|s|s
me011|well we had we had talked about doing maybe e d u as a good choice though.|S|s|ng
me011|well whatever we have.|S|s|s
me018|well we've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me018|but for the purpose of sending him a sample one to|D|s|s
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me011|yeah maybe it doesn't matter.|S|s|am
fe008|great.|F|fg|fg
me018|i i don't think it|D|s|s
fe008|i'll i'll i'll um get make that available.|S|s|cc
me011|okay and has it been corrected?|S|s|bk
fe008|oh well wait.|S|h|h
fe008|um|F|h|h
me011|hand checked?|Q|qy|bu
me011|because that was one of the processes we were talking about as well.|S|s|df
me018|right so we need to run thilo's thing on it.|S|fh|fh
fe008|that's right.|S|s|bk
me018|and then we go in and adjust the boundaries.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah we haven't done that.|S|s|s
me011|and time how long it takes.|S|s|e
fe008|i i could set someone on that tomorrow.|S|s|cc
me018|right.|B|b|b
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
me018|and we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just want to send them a sample to try.|S|s|s
fe008|i think they're coming|D|s|s
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|what would be a good number of minutes?|Q|qw|qw
me018|i don't know.|S|s|no
me018|maybe we can figure out how long it'll take to to do|D|s|cs
me011|um|F|fg|fg
me011|i don't know.|S|s|no
me011|it seems to me we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting.|S|s|cs
me011|because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime.|S|s|df
me013|yes.|S|s|arp
me013|except that if they had if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them|D|s|s
me013|it's just dependent of how much|D|s|s
me011|like i i mean i guess if we have to do it again anyway.|S|s|s
me011|but uh|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|am
me018|i guess the only thing i'm not sure about is um|D|s|s
me018|how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|and|D|%|%
me018|i mean is it pretty easy?|Q|qy|rt
me011|i think it's going to be one or two times real time at|D|s|s
me011|wow excuse me two or more times real time!|S|s|fe
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|because they have to at least listen to it.|S|s|df
me013|can we pipeline it so that say there's uh the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff?|Q|qy|rt
me011|well the other stuff is i b m.|S|s|ng
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me011|i'm just thinking that from a data keeping track of the data point of view it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces.|S|s|s
me013|okay so|F|fg|fg
me013|oh that's right.|S|s|aa
me013|so the first thing is the automatic thing.|S|s|bu
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|and then it's then it's then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up.|S|s|e
me013|and then it's i b m.|S|s|e
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|S|s|aa
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|okay so you might as well run the automatic thing over the entire meeting.|S|s|cs
me013|and then and then uh you would give i b m whatever was fixed.|S|s|s
fe008|and have them fix it over the entire meeting too.|S|s|e
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|well yeah but start from the beginning and go to the end.|S|s|aap
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so if they were only half way through then that's what you'd give i b m.|S|s|s
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me018|as of what point?|Q|qw|bu
me018|i mean|D|%|%
me018|the i guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i b m?|Q|qy|rt
me018|or do we go ahead and send them a sample?|Q|qrr|qrr
me013|why wouldn't we|D|qw|qw
me018|let their|D|%|%
me013|if they were going sequentially through it why wouldn't we give them|D|qw|qw
me013|i mean are we trying to get something done by the time brian comes?|Q|qy|qy
me018|well i i i mean i don't know.|S|s|no
me011|that was the question though.|S|s|s
me013|so if we if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to would be better than nothing.|S|s|s
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|uh that i agree.|S|s|aa
me018|i agree.|S|s|aa
me011|well i don't think|D|fg|fg
me011|i mean they they typically work for what four hours something like that?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|huh i huh.|S|s|aa
me011|i think they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting.|S|s|s
me011|i would think.|S|s|s
me011|unless it's a lot harder than we think it is.|S|s|s
me011|which it could be certainly.|S|s|s
fe008|if it's got like for speakers then i guess i mean if|D|s|s
me011|or seven or eight.|S|s|e
me018|we're just doing the individual channels.|S|s|bu
me018|right?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|individual channels.|S|s|m
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|so it's going to be depending on the number of people in the meeting|D|s|s
me018|um|F|fh|fh
fe008|i guess there is this issue of you know if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch on a particular channel.|S|s|s
me011|well|F|fg|fg
fe008|and there really was then if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify then it might be overlooked.|S|s|s
fe008|so i mean the question is should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it can it be based on the mixed signal?|Q|fh|fh
fe008|and i uh so far as i'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point.|S|s|s
fe008|and|F|fh|fh
me011|that's what it seems to me too in that if they need to just like in the other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to.|S|s|s
fe008|and that cuts down the time.|S|s|e
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but they don't have to for most of it.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah that's good.|S|s|ba
fe008|so yeah.|F|fh|fh
me018|i don't see how that will work though.|S|s|s
fe008|good good good.|B|b|b
fe008|what what aspect?|Q|qw|rt
me013|so you're talking about tightening up time boundaries.|S|s|bu
me018|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|so they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line.|S|s|s
me013|so how do you|D|qw|qw
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but you're listening to the mixed signal and you're tightening the boundaries.|S|s|s
me011|correcting the boundaries.|S|s|bsc
me011|you shouldn't have to tighten them too much because thilo's program does that.|S|s|s
fe008|should be pretty good.|D|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|except for it doesn't do well on short things remember.|S|s|arp
me011|right so so you'll have to i|D|fg|fg
fe016|it will miss them.|S|s|s
fe016|it will miss most of the really short things.|S|s|r
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|like that.|S|s|s
fe008|but those would be those would be|D|s|s
fe016|uhhuh.|S|s|m
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe016|it will it will miss|D|s|s
fe016|yeah you have to say uhhuh more slowly to to get|D|s|co
me011|sorry.|S|s|fa
me011|i'll work on that.|S|s|cc
fe016|no i'm i'm actually serious.|S|s|s
fe016|so it will miss stuff like that which|D|s|s
me011|well so so that's something that the transcribers will have to have to do.|S|fg|fg
me018|i|D|%|%
fe008|yeah but presumably most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavy overlap section.|S|fg|fg
fe008|when in which case they'd be listening to the channels anyway.|S|s|s
fe016|right.|B|b|b
me018|that's that's what i'm i'm concerned about the part.|S|s|s
fe016|and that's what i'm not sure about.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|i am too.|S|s|aa
fe008|and i think it's an empirical question.|S|s|s
me018|can't we uh couldn't we just have um|D|s|s
me018|i don't know maybe this just doesn't fit with the software.|S|s|s
me018|but i guess if i didn't know anything about transcriber and i was going to make something to let them adjust boundaries i would just show them one channel at a time with the marks and let them|D|s|s
fe008|oh they can|D|s|s
me011|well but then they have to do|D|s|nd
me011|but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time and it would probably be more than that.|D|s|nd
fe008|yeah that's it.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|because they'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through.|S|s|df
me018|but but it's very quick.|S|s|s
fe008|and if|D|%|%
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|right?|Q|qy|d
me018|i mean you scan i mean if you have a display of the waveform.|S|s|s
me011|oh you're talking about visually.|S|s|bu
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i just don't think|D|s|nd
fe008|well the other problem is the breaths.|S|fg|fg
fe008|because you also see the breaths on the waveform.|S|s|df
fe008|i've i've looked at the uh i've tried to do that with a single channel.|S|s|s
fe008|and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|yeah and i i think that they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals.|S|s|s
fe008|well that that i'm not sure.|S|s|am
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|what you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|i know for a fact that one of those she could really well she could judge what what the number was based on the on the waveform.|S|fh|fh
me011|yeah that's actually true.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah you're right.|S|s|aa
me011|you're absolutely right.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah i found the same thing that when i was scanning through the wave form i could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah she could tell which one was seven.|S|s|s
me011|um maybe.|S|s|am
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so i don't|D|%|%
me011|but|F|fg|fg
me013|i'm i'm now entirely confused about what they do.|S|s|s
me013|so they're they're looking at a mixed signal?|Q|fh|fh
me013|or they're looking|D|qrr|rt
me013|what what are they looking at visually?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|well they have a choice.|S|fg|fg
fe008|they could choose any signal to look at.|S|s|s
fe008|i've tried but usually they look at the mixed.|S|s|s
fe008|but i've i've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't.|S|s|s
me011|oh.|B|b|b
fe008|but the problem is then you have breaths which which show up on the signal.|S|s|s
me013|but the procedure that you're imagining i mean people vary from this is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them.|S|s|bu
fe008|yes.|B|b|b
fe008|yes.|B|b|b
me013|and they have multiple|D|s|s
me013|uh well let's see there isn't we don't have transcription yet.|S|fh|fh
me013|so but there's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically.|S|fh|fh
me011|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|yes.|S|s|aa
me013|and those show up on the mixed signal?|Q|qy|bu
me013|there's a clicks?|Q|qy|rt
me011|the|D|%|%
fe008|oh!|S|s|fe
fe008|they show up on the separate ribbons.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|so you have a separate ribbon for each channel.|S|s|rt
me013|there're separate ribbons.|S|s|bk
fe008|and and it'll be because it's being segmented as channel at a time with his with thilo's new procedure.|S|s|s
fe008|then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins uh across the ribbons.|S|s|s
fe008|uh you could have|D|s|s
me013|and is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes?|Q|qy|rt
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
fe008|yes.|S|s|aa
me013|okay so the way you're imaging is they kind of play it.|S|s|bk
me013|and they see oh this happened then this happened then and if it's about right they just sort of let it slide.|S|s|bu
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|and if it if it there's a question on something they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form.|S|s|bu
me011|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh well not not look.|S|s|bk
me011|well they wouldn't look at it at this point.|S|s|nd
me011|they would just listen.|S|s|e
me013|they they might look at it.|S|s|s
me011|well the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals.|S|s|s
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|not very quickly.|S|s|e
me011|the problem is that that the tcl t.k. interface with the visuals it's very slow to load waveforms.|S|s|s
fe008|you can but it takes time.|S|s|s
fe008|that's it.|S|s|aa
me013|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me011|and so when i tried that that was the first thing i tried when i first started it.|S|s|df
fe008|oh oh.|S|s|bk
fe008|visually.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|you can you can switch quickly between the audio.|S|s|s
fe008|but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly.|S|s|s
fe008|so you have to|D|s|co
fe008|it takes i don't know three four minutes to|D|s|s
fe008|well i mean it takes it takes long enough|D|fh|fh
fe016|yeah it's very slow to do that.|S|fg|fg
fe008|it takes long enough because it has to reload the|D|s|r
fe008|i i don't know exactly what it's doing frankly.|S|s|no
fe008|because but it it takes long enough that it's just not a practical alternative.|S|s|s
fe016|that|D|%|%
me011|well it it does some sort of shape pre computation so that it can then scroll it quickly.|S|s|s
me001|but you can cancel that.|S|s|cs
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly.|S|s|ng
me001|oh really?|Q|qy|bh
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me001|huh!|B|b|b
fe008|now you could set up multiple windows each one with a different signal showing and then look between the windows.|S|s|cs
fe008|maybe that's the solution.|S|s|s
me011|i mean we we could do different interfaces.|S|s|cs
me001|what if you preload them all?|Q|qw|cs
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|i mean so so we could use like x waves instead of transcriber.|S|s|cs
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|and it loads faster certainly.|S|s|e
me001|what if you were to preload all the channels or or initially?|Q|qr|cs
me001|like doesn't|D|%|%
me011|well that's what i tried originally.|S|s|s
me011|so i i actually before uh dave gelbart did this i did an interface which showed each waveform and a ribbon for each waveform.|S|s|s
me001|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll.|S|s|s
me001|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me011|so you just scroll a screen and it would you know go kur chunk!|S|s|fe
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|and so it just was not doable with the current interface.|S|s|s
fe008|you know i am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers.|S|s|s
fe008|and you know you could fire up a transcriber interface for you know in different windows multiple ones one for each channel.|S|s|cs
fe008|and it's sort of a a hack but i mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form.|S|s|df
me011|i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals we need to change the interface so that they can do that.|S|s|cs
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|that's actually what i thought of loading the chopped up waveforms i mean you know that that would make it faster.|S|s|na
me013|so|F|fg|fg
me001|huh.|B|b|b
me011|but isn't|D|%|%
me011|the chopped up waveforms.|S|s|m
me018|the problem is if if anything's cut off you can't expand it from the chopped up.|S|s|s
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
me011|isn't that|D|%|%
me001|right.|B|b|b
fe016|right but if you|D|s|aa
me011|and wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal?|Q|qy|bu
fe016|at some point|D|s|s
fe016|no i mean the individual channels that were chopped up that|D|s|ar
fe016|it'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments.|S|s|cs
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|because you don't really like nine tenths of the time you're throwing most of them out.|S|s|df
fe016|but what you need are that particular channel or that particular location.|S|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|and|D|%|%
fe016|um might be nice because we save those out already um to be able to do that.|S|fh|fh
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|but it won't work for i b m of course.|S|s|s
fe016|it only works here because they're not saving out the individual channels.|S|s|e
fe008|well i i do think that this this will be a doable procedure.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and have them starting with mixed.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|B|b|b
fe008|and um then when they get into overlaps just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from from audio view.|S|fh|fh
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah hopefully i mean|D|fh|fh
me011|the mixed signal the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized.|S|s|s
me011|so i think they should be able to hear.|S|s|s
me011|the only problem is is you know counting how many and if they're really correct or not.|S|s|s
me011|so i don't know.|S|fh|fh
fe016|i don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal.|S|s|s
me011|right but but once once you know that they happen you can at least listen to the close talking.|S|s|bk
fe016|but you would know that they were there and then you would switch.|S|s|df
fe016|right.|S|s|aa
fe016|and then you would switch into the other|D|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|but right now to do this limitation the switching is going to be switching of the audio is what she's saying.|S|s|bs
me011|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|so so.|F|fh|fh
me011|did dave did dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels?|Q|qy|rt
me013|so they're using their ears to do these markings anyway.|S|s|bu
fe008|yes.|S|s|aa
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yes.|S|s|aa
fe008|click|D|%|%
fe008|um|F|h|h
me011|i had suggested it before.|S|s|s
me011|i just don't know whether he did it or not.|S|s|s
fe008|i'm not sure what click what click on the ribbon?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|yeah you can get that.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh oh!|S|s|fe
fe008|get you can get the uh you can get it to switch audio?|Q|qy|bu
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|uh not last i tried.|S|h|h
fe008|but um maybe he's changed it again.|S|fh|fh
me011|we should get him to do that.|S|s|cs
me011|because uh i think that would be much much faster than going to the menu.|S|s|df
fe008|i disagree.|S|s|ar
fe008|there's a reason i disagree and that is that uh you it's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio.|S|s|df
fe008|there're times when i want to hear the mixed signal.|S|s|e
fe008|but i want to transcribe on the single channel.|S|s|s
fe008|so right now|D|fh|fh
me011|then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it.|S|s|cs
fe008|maybe i just don't i don't see that it's a|D|s|am
me011|just something so that it's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster.|S|s|s
fe008|well i mean that's the i i think that might be a personal style thing.|S|h|h
fe008|i find it really convenient the way the way it's set up right now.|S|s|s
me011|well it just seems to me that if you want to quickly well was that jane no was that chuck no was that morgan right now you have to go up to the menu.|S|fg|fg
me011|and each time go up to the menu select it listen to that channel then click below.|S|s|s
me011|and then go back to the menu select the next one and then click below.|S|s|s
fe008|that's fine.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah it's true.|S|s|aa
me011|so you can definitely streamline that with the with the interface.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah it could be faster.|S|s|aa
fe008|but you know i mean in the ideal world|D|s|j
me011|what?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|no i i agree that'd be nice.|S|s|ba
me011|okay.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me013|so um we're done with that?|Q|fg|fg
me013|then today|D|%|%
me013|i forget.|S|s|df
me013|does anybody uh working on any any eurospeech submission related to this?|Q|qy|rt
me011|i would like to try to do something on digits.|S|s|na
me011|but i just don't know if we have time.|S|s|s
me011|i mean it's due next friday.|S|s|s
me011|so we have to do the experiments and write the paper.|S|s|s
me011|so i'm going to try.|S|fh|fh
me011|but uh|F|fh|fh
me011|we'll just have to see.|S|s|s
me011|so actually i want to get together with both andreas and uh uh stephane with their respective systems.|S|s|rt
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah there was that|D|fg|fg
me013|that's right.|S|s|bk
me013|we had that one conversation about uh what what what did it mean for uh one of those speakers to be pathological.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|was it a|D|qy|qy
me011|and i haven't had chance to sit down and listen.|S|s|s
mn017|oh i haven't i haven't listened to them either.|S|s|s
me011|i was going to do that this afternoon.|S|s|cc
mn017|but there must be something wrong.|S|s|s
mn017|i mean|F|fh|fh
mn017|unless our|D|%|%
me011|well morgan and i were were having a debate about that.|S|fg|fg
me011|whereas i think it's probably something pathologic.|S|s|s
me011|and actually stephane's results i think confirm that.|S|s|s
me011|he he did the aurora system.|S|s|s
me011|also got very lousy average error like fifteen or or uh fifteen to twenty percent average.|S|s|rt
me011|but then he ran it just on the lapel and got about five or six percent word error.|S|s|rt
me011|so that that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases.|S|s|s
me011|but you know we that may not be true.|S|fh|fh
me011|it may be just some of the segments they're just doing a lousy job on.|S|s|am
me011|so i'll i'll listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by segment.|S|s|cc
me013|right.|B|b|b
me011|so i can actually listen to it.|S|s|s
mn017|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|did you run the andreas the s r i recognizer on the digits?|Q|qy|rt
mn017|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|oh i thought he had sent that around to everyone.|S|s|s
me011|did you just sent that to me?|Q|qy|rt
mn017|no i i didn't.|S|s|ar
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
mn017|since i considered those preliminary i didn't.|S|s|df
mn017|but yeah if you take|D|%|%
me018|it wasn't|D|%|%
me011|it was bimodal.|S|s|s
mn017|so if you|D|%|%
mn017|yeah it's actually um it uh it was trimodal actually.|S|s|ar
me011|oh was it trimodal ? okay.|S|qy|bh
mn017|trimodal.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn017|so|F|fh|fh
me013|there's zero a little bit and a lot.|S|s|s
mn017|there were there was there was one one bump at around zero which were the native speakers.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|the non pathological native speakers.|S|s|e
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|zero percent error?|Q|qy|d
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|then there was another bump at um oh like fifteen or something.|S|s|s
me013|oh was it fifteen?|Q|qy|bu
me018|this is error you're talking about?|Q|qy|bu
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn017|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
mn017|those were the non natives.|S|s|s
mn017|and then there was another distinct bump at like a hundred which must have been some problem.|S|s|s
fe008|oh wow!|S|s|fe
mn017|i can't imagine that.|S|s|s
fe008|oh okay.|B|b|b
me001|what is what do you mean by pathological?|Q|qw|rt
me001|i'm sorry i don't|D|s|fa
me011|just just something really wrong with|D|s|s
me001|oh.|S|s|bk
mn017|in the recording.|S|s|2
me011|a bug is what i mean.|S|s|s
me011|so that it's like|D|s|s
me001|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me001|i see.|S|s|bk
mn017|and there was this one meeting i forget which one it was where like uh six out of the eight channels were all like had a hundred percent error.|S|s|s
me011|which probably means like there was a the recording interface crashed.|S|s|s
me001|right.|B|b|b
me011|or there was a short you know someone was jiggling with a cord.|S|s|s
mn017|but|F|fg|fg
me011|or uh i extracted it incorrectly.|S|s|s
mn017|but|F|fg|fg
me011|it was labeled.|S|s|s
me001|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|it was transcribed incorrectly.|S|s|s
me011|something really bad happened.|S|s|s
me001|okay.|B|b|b
me011|and i just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was.|S|s|s
mn017|so if i excluded the pathological ones by definition those that had like over ninety five percent error rate and the non natives then the average error rate was like one point four or something.|S|fg|fg
me013|if what we're calling|D|s|s
fe008|oh!|S|s|fe
me001|huh.|B|b|b
mn017|which which seemed reasonable given that you know the models weren't tuned for for it.|S|s|s
fe008|oh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|and the grammar wasn't tuned either.|S|s|s
mn017|it was just a|D|s|s
me018|and it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the|D|qrr|bu
mn017|i haven't split it up that way.|S|s|ng
mn017|but it would be|D|%|%
fe016|but there's no overlap during the digit readings so it shouldn't really matter.|S|s|s
me001|right.|B|b|b
mn017|right.|B|b|b
me018|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn017|so it should|D|s|s
me013|no but there's a little difference.|S|s|ar
me011|there's a lot.|S|s|s
me013|and we haven't looked at it for digits.|S|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|and so|F|fh|fh
me018|yeah so i was curious about that.|S|s|s
me013|because because what he was what i was saying when i looked at those things is it it i was almost going to call it quadrimodal because because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent.|S|s|s
mn017|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|they just plain got it all right.|S|s|s
mn017|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and then there and then there was another bunch that were a couple percent or something.|S|s|s
mn017|but if you if you actually histogrammed it and it was a nice uh you know it it was zero was the most of them.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|a normal.|S|s|2
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|but then there were the others were sort of decaying from there.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|and then there was the bump for the non natives and then the pathological ones.|S|s|s
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
mn017|so|F|fh|fh
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
me011|yeah because some of our non natives are pretty non native.|S|fg|fg
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|B|b|rt
fe008|you did you have uh something in the report about uh about uh uh forced alignment?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|have you have you started on that?|Q|qy|rt
mn017|oh well yeah so i've been struggling with the forced alignments.|S|h|h
mn017|um so the scheme that i drew on the board last time where we tried to um allow reject models for the speech from other speakers.|S|fh|fh
mn017|um most of the time it doesn't work very well.|S|fh|fh
mn017|so um and the i haven't done i mean the only way to check this right now was for me to actually load these into x waves and you know plus the alignments and play them and see where the|D|fh|fh
me013|huh.|B|b|b
mn017|and it looks and so i looked at all of the utterances from you chuck in that one conversation.|S|s|s
mn017|i don't know which you probably know which one i mean it's where you were on the lapel and morgan was sitting next to you.|S|s|s
mn017|and we can hear everything morgan says.|S|s|s
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
mn017|but and and some of what you i mean you also appear quite a bit in that cross talk.|S|fh|fh
mn017|so i actually went through all of those.|S|fh|fh
mn017|there were i think fifty five segments um in in x waves and and sort of did a crude check.|S|s|s
mn017|and more often than not it it gets it wrong.|S|fh|fh
mn017|so there's either the beginning mostly the beginning word where you um you know chuck talks somewhere into the segment.|S|s|s
mn017|but the first um word of what he says often i.|S|s|s
mn017|but it's very reduced i.|S|s|s
mn017|that's just aligned to the beginning of someone else's speech uh in that segment.|S|s|s
mn017|which is cross talk.|S|s|s
mn017|so um i'm still tinkering with it.|S|fh|fh
mn017|but it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this out of those uh channels.|S|s|s
mn017|so|F|fh|fh
me013|unless maybe we do this uh um cancellation business?|Q|qy|bu
fe016|right but that's i mean that was our plan.|S|s|aa
mn017|yeah right.|S|s|aa
fe016|but it's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time.|S|s|s
me013|oh the short amount of time thing right.|S|s|s
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
fe016|so we you know we had spent a lot of time um writing up the h l t paper.|S|s|s
fe016|and we wanted to use that uh kind of analysis.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|but the h l t paper has you know it's a very crude measure of overlap.|S|s|s
fe016|it's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap.|S|s|s
fe016|it's just whether or not the um the segments that were all synchronized whether there was some overlap somewhere.|S|s|s
me011|high correlation.|S|s|2
fe016|and you know that pointed out some differences.|S|fh|fh
fe016|so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross cancellation it's not straight forward.|S|s|s
fe016|if it were straight forward then we would try it.|S|s|s
fe016|but|F|fh|fh
fe016|so it's sort of good to hear that it was not straight forward thinking if we can get decent forced alignments then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time.|S|s|s
fe016|but um|F|fh|fh
me018|i didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight forward.|S|s|ng
me011|well if we'd just|D|s|s
me013|well|F|fg|fg
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|i thought he's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it.|S|s|bu
fe016|the but there are some issues of this timing um in the recordings.|S|s|ng
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|and|F|fh|fh
me018|right.|F|fg|fg
me018|so you just have to look over longer time when you're trying to align the things.|S|s|cs
me018|you can't you can't just look|D|s|s
me011|well are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time synchronous?|D|fg|fg
me011|is that what you're referring to?|Q|qy|rt
me013|sure.|B|b|b
me011|that seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a very accurate.|S|s|s
mn017|i don't i i don't think that was the issue.|S|s|nd
fe016|i|F|fg|fg
fe016|yeah that was sort of a side issue.|S|fg|fg
mn017|the issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels.|S|s|s
me011|i didn't think so either.|S|s|aa
fe016|and it's dynamic so i guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able to|D|s|s
fe016|so so there are some things available.|S|s|s
fe016|and i don't know too much about this area.|S|s|no
fe016|where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them.|S|s|s
fe016|and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference.|S|s|s
me011|right which should be pretty straight forward.|S|s|aa
fe016|which at least is well defined.|S|s|s
fe016|and|F|fh|fh
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|um but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances then it wasn't|D|fh|fh
fe016|i guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now.|S|s|s
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
fe016|well less than a week.|S|s|bsc
fe016|so um so i don't know what we can do if anything that's sort of worth you know a eurospeech paper at this point.|S|fh|fh
me018|well andreas how well did it work on the non lapel stuff?|Q|qy|rt
me011|yeah that's what i was going to say.|S|s|s
mn017|i haven't checked those yet.|S|s|no
mn017|it's very tedious to check these.|S|s|df
me018|huh.|B|b|b
mn017|um we would really need ideally a transcriber to time mark the you know the at least the beginning and ends of contiguous speech.|S|fh|fh
mn017|um and you know then with the time marks you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments.|S|fh|fh
me018|because really the the at least in terms of how we were going to use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea uh for each channel about the start and end boundaries.|S|s|s
me011|oh m n c m.|D|s|s
me011|alignments.|S|s|s
mn017|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|we don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries.|S|s|s
mn017|no that's how i've been looking at it.|S|s|aa
me018|so|F|fh|fh
mn017|i mean i don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly.|S|s|e
fe016|right.|B|b|b
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
mn017|but you don't want to uh infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't.|S|fh|fh
me018|right exactly.|S|s|aa
mn017|so so|D|fh|fh
me018|so that's why i was wondering if it|D|s|s
me018|i mean maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff we can just not use that.|S|s|cs
mn017|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn017|i haven't i just haven't had the time to um do the same procedure on one of the|D|s|s
me018|and|F|fh|fh
mn017|so i would need a i would need a channel that has a speaker whose who has a lot of overlap but you know is a non lapel mike.|S|s|s
mn017|and um where preferably also there's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot.|S|fh|fh
me011|huh.|B|b|b
mn017|so i|D|fh|fh
me011|so a meeting with me in it.|S|s|bs
mn017|maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then i would be willing to|D|s|cs
me018|we you know what?|Q|qh|qh
me018|maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these.|S|s|cs
mn017|you know|D|%|%
me018|because you can see the seat numbers.|S|s|df
me018|and then you can see what type of mike they were using.|S|s|s
me018|and so we just look for you know somebody sitting next to adam at one of the meetings.|S|s|s
fe016|actually we can tell from the data that we have.|S|s|s
mn017|from the insertions maybe?|Q|qy|2
mn017|from the|D|%|%
fe016|um yeah there's a way to tell.|S|fh|fh
fe016|it might not be a single person who's always overlapping that person but any number of people.|S|s|s
mn017|right.|S|s|aa
fe016|and um if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels you know just word alignment you'd be able to find that.|S|fh|fh
fe016|so so i guess that's sort of a last|D|fh|fh
fe016|there're sort of a few things we could do.|S|s|cs
fe016|one is just do like non lapels if we can get good enough alignments.|S|s|s
fe016|another one was to try to get|D|s|s
fe016|somehow align thilo's energy segmentations with what we have.|S|s|s
fe016|but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation.|S|s|s
fe016|but maybe there's something that could be done.|S|s|s
me018|what what is why do you need the um the forced alignment for the h l t i mean for the eurospeech paper?|Q|qw|rt
fe016|well i guess i i wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments.|S|h|h
fe016|because that's way too early but to be able to report you know actual numbers.|S|s|df
fe016|like if we if we had hand transcribed good alignments or hand checked alignments then we could do this paper.|S|s|s
fe016|it's not that we need it to be automatic.|S|s|s
fe016|but without knowing where the real words are in time|D|s|s
me018|so it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in.|S|s|bu
fe016|to to know what an overlap really if it's really an overlap or if it's just a a a segment correlated with an overlap.|S|s|s
me018|uh okay.|S|s|bk
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|and i guess that's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of promissory paper.|S|s|s
fe016|so um if we|D|fh|fh
fe016|it might be possible to take thilo's output|D|s|s
fe016|and like if you have um like right now these meetings are all.|S|s|s
me011|ugh!|S|s|fe
me011|i forgot the digital camera again.|S|s|t1
fe016|um|F|fh|fh
me011|every meeting.|S|s|e
fe016|you know they're time aligned.|S|s|s
fe016|so if these are two different channels and somebody's talking here and somebody else is talking here just that word.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|if thilo can tell us that there're boundaries here we should be able to figure that out.|S|s|s
fe016|because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word.|S|s|df
fe016|but um you know if there are things|D|fh|fh
me011|two words.|S|s|2
fe016|yeah if you have two and they're at the edges it's like here and here.|S|s|aa
fe016|and there's speech here then it doesn't really help you.|S|s|s
fe016|so um|F|fh|fh
me018|thilo's won't put down two separate marks in that case?|Q|qy|bu
fe016|well it it would but um we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin.|S|s|arp
me011|thilo's will but|D|s|aa
fe016|and we don't really know|D|s|no
fe008|well it's a merging problem.|S|s|s
fe016|i mean.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah it's|F|fg|fg
fe008|if you had a if you had a if you had a script which would|D|s|s
fe008|i've thought about this.|S|s|s
fe016|i mean if you have any ideas.|S|s|s
fe008|um and i've discussed i've discussed it with thilo.|S|fh|fh
fe016|i would|D|%|%
fe008|um the i mean i i in principle i could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree.|S|fh|fh
fe008|but there is this problem of slippage.|S|s|s
me011|well maybe maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful.|S|fg|fg
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|right.|F|fg|fg
fe016|i mean that that would be really helpful.|S|s|s
fe016|that was sort of another possibility.|S|s|s
me011|you know because it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts.|S|s|s
me011|or at least a single phrase.|S|s|e
mn017|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|well they they can be stretched.|S|s|s
me011|in most of the bins.|S|s|e
fe008|i wouldn't make that generalization.|S|s|ng
fe016|yeah.|B|b|rt
fe008|because sometimes people will say and then i and there's a long pause.|S|s|df
fe008|and finish the sentence.|S|s|s
fe008|and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the|D|s|s
fe008|i mean it's it's not a simple problem.|S|s|s
fe008|but it's really|D|s|s
fe008|and then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes you know with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off.|S|s|rt
fe008|and so it's coupled with the problem that thilo's isn't perfect either.|S|s|s
fe008|i mean we've it's like you have a merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of uh not|D|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
me011|huh!|B|b|b
fe008|if the speech-nonspeech were perfect to begin with the detector that would already be an improvement.|S|s|s
fe008|but that's impossible you know that's too much to ask.|S|s|s
fe016|right.|B|b|b
me011|yes.|B|b|b
fe008|and so and you know i mean it's|D|s|s
fe008|i think that there always there would have to be some hand tweaking.|S|s|s
fe008|but it's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things.|S|s|s
fe008|i've i've discussed it with thilo and i mean|D|s|s
fe008|in terms of not him doing it.|S|s|e
fe008|but we we discussed some of the parameters of that.|S|s|s
fe008|and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that.|S|s|s
fe016|i mean i guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with.|S|s|s
fe016|then we have a good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to.|S|s|s
fe008|well it's just you know a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution of improved uh interface um one month too late.|S|s|s
me011|oh.|B|b|b
fe016|so i'm i don't know if this|D|s|no
me011|tools.|S|s|2
fe008|but it's like you know it's wonderful to have the revolution.|S|s|s
fe016|oh it's it's a|D|%|%
fe008|so it's just a matter of of you know from now on we'll be able to have things channelized to begin with.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|and we'll just have to see how hard that is.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|so so whether the corrections take too much time.|S|fh|fh
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|i was just thinking about the fact that if thilo's missed these short segments that might be quite time consuming for them to insert them.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|good point.|S|s|ba
fe016|but he he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|spurious.|S|s|2
fe016|but that might be okay.|S|s|rt
me011|it might be easier to delete something that's wrong than to insert something that's missing.|S|s|s
fe016|right.|S|s|aa
fe016|and you can also see in the waveform|D|s|s
me011|what do you think jane?|Q|qw|rt
fe016|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|if you can feel confident that what the yeah that there's actually something|D|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|because then then you just delete it and you don't have to pick a time.|S|s|s
me013|that you're not going to miss something.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe016|i think it's|D|s|s
fe008|well the problem is i you know i i it's a it's a really good question.|S|s|s
fe008|and i really find it a pain in the neck to delete things.|S|s|s
fe008|because you have to get the mouse up there on the on the text line.|S|s|df
fe008|and and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down.|S|s|s
fe008|i mean it depends on how|D|s|s
fe008|i mean there's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other or or vice versa.|S|s|s
fe008|it's not a simple question.|S|s|s
fe008|but you know i mean in principle like you know if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one's easier.|S|s|s
me011|yeah i guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment.|S|fg|fg
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|because you would say you would have to determine what the surroundings were.|S|s|df
fe016|you could just say it's a noise though and write you know a post processor will just|D|s|cs
fe016|all you have to do is just|D|s|s
me011|if it's really a noise.|S|s|s
fe016|or it'll just say it's just put x you know like not speech or something.|S|s|cs
fe016|and then you can get|D|s|s
fe008|i think it's easier to add than delete frankly.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah or|B|b|b
fe008|because you have to uh maneuver around on the on both windows then.|S|s|df
me011|to add or to delete?|Q|qr|d
fe008|to delete.|S|s|s
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
fe016|anyways so i i guess|D|fg|fg
me011|that maybe that's an interface issue that might be addressable.|S|s|am
me011|but i think it's the semantics that are that are questionable to me.|S|s|s
fe008|it's possible.|S|s|s
me011|that you delete something|D|s|s
me011|so let's say someone is talking to here and then you have a little segment here.|S|s|s
me011|well is that part of the speech?|Q|qy|rt
me011|is it part of the non speech?|Q|qy|qy
me011|i mean what do you embed it in?|Q|qw|qw
fe016|there's something nice though about keeping and this is probably another discussion keeping the stuff that thilo's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it.|S|s|s
fe016|because then when you align it then the alignment can you can put a reject model or whatever.|S|s|df
me011|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me011|so then they could just like put|D|s|cs
me011|oh that's what you meant by just put an x there.|S|s|s
fe016|and you're consistent with the automatic system.|S|s|df
me011|uh that's an interesting idea.|S|s|ba
fe016|whereas if you delete it|D|s|s
me011|so so all they so that all they would have to do is put like an x there.|S|s|bs
fe016|yeah or some you know dummy reject|D|s|aa
me011|so blank for blank for silence.|S|s|s
me011|s for speech.|S|s|s
me011|x for something else.|S|s|s
fe016|whatever.|S|s|2
fe016|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe016|that's actually a better way to do it.|S|s|ba
fe016|because the the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than|D|s|df
fe008|well like i think there's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in the|D|fg|fg
fe016|i mean if it's just as easy.|S|s|s
fe016|but|F|fh|fh
fe008|uh you know on the same channel the same speaker.|S|fh|fh
fe008|so now sometimes you get a microphone pop.|S|fh|fh
fe008|and uh i mean there're these fuzzy hybrid cases.|S|fh|fh
fe008|and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around.|S|s|s
fe008|it's not a simple not a simple problem.|S|s|s
fe016|anyway quick question though at a high level do people think|D|fg|fg
fe016|let's just say that we're moving to this new era of like using the um pre segmented you know non synchronous conversations.|S|s|s
fe016|does it make sense to try to take what we have now which are the ones that you know we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time tightened and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings or is it better to just you know forget that and|D|qr|qr
me011|well i think we'll have to eventually.|S|s|s
fe016|i mean it's|D|%|%
me011|and my hope was that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it.|D|s|s
fe016|right.|S|s|aa
me011|but if we can't|D|s|s
fe016|that was everybody's hope.|S|s|s
me011|but if we can't then maybe we just have to|D|s|r
fe016|and maybe we can for the non lapel but|D|s|am
fe016|is it worth|D|qy|qy
fe016|if we can't then we can fake it even if we're we report you know we're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time.|S|s|rt
me011|well i'm thinking|D|s|s
me011|are you talking about for a paper or are talking about for the corpus?|D|qr|qr
fe016|uh uh that's a good question actually.|S|h|h
me011|i mean because for the corpus it would be nice if everything were|D|s|s
fe016|actually that's a good question.|S|s|ba
fe016|because we'd have to completely redo those meetings and we have like ten of them now.|S|s|df
me011|we wouldn't have to re do them.|S|s|s
me011|we would just have to edit them.|S|s|s
fe008|well and also i mean i still haven't i still haven't given up on forced alignment.|S|s|s
fe016|no you're right.|S|s|aa
fe016|actually|D|%|%
fe008|i think that when brian comes this'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well|D|s|s
me011|when|D|qw|qw
fe008|when brian kingsbury comes.|S|s|rt
me011|oh brian.|S|s|bk
me011|you i thought you said ryan.|S|s|s
me011|and it's like who's ryan.|S|s|s
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah good question.|S|s|s
fe008|well ryan could come.|S|fh|fh
fe016|uh no that's a good point though.|S|s|ba
fe016|because for feature extraction like for prosody or something i mean the meetings we have now|D|s|df
fe016|it's a good chunk of data.|S|s|s
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
fe016|we need to get a decent|D|s|co
fe016|okay.|S|s|t
fe008|that's what my hope has been.|S|s|s
fe016|so we should at least try it even if we can't.|S|s|cs
fe008|and that's what that's what you know ever since the the february meeting that i transcribed from last year forced alignment has been on the on the table as a way of cleaning them up later.|S|s|s
fe016|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|on the table.|S|s|m
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|and and so i'm hopeful that that's possible.|S|s|s
fe008|i know that there's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes.|S|s|s
mn017|there's|D|%|%
mn017|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|but|F|fh|fh
fe016|i mean we might be able at the very worst we can get transcribers to correct the cases where|D|s|cs
fe016|i mean you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition's so poor.|S|s|s
fe016|right?|Q|qy|d
fe016|and so you're|D|s|s
me018|yeah we were never just going to go with these as the final alignments.|S|s|s
fe008|i agree.|S|s|aa
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|i agree.|S|s|aa
me018|we were always going to run them past somebody.|S|s|s
fe016|so we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments.|S|s|bs
fe008|absolutely.|S|s|aa
mn017|i'm probably going to spend another day or so trying to improve things by um by using um acoustic adaptation.|S|s|cc
mn017|um the right now i'm using the unadapted models for the forced alignments.|S|fh|fh
mn017|and it's possible that you get considerably better results if you uh manage to adapt the uh phone models to the speaker and the reject model to the to to all the other speech.|S|s|cs
mn017|um so|F|fh|fh
me018|could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels?|Q|qy|rt
me013|that's what he just said.|S|s|aa
me011|that's what he was saying.|S|s|aa
mn017|that's what i just said.|S|s|aa
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|oh not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel.|S|s|ng
mn017|right.|S|s|aa
fe016|right.|S|s|aa
me018|but the speech from the actual other channels.|S|s|s
mn017|oh oh i see.|S|s|bk
mn017|um|F|h|h
me011|i don't think so.|S|s|ar
me013|oh.|S|s|bk
me011|i don't think that would work.|S|s|s
mn017|no it|D|%|%
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|because you'd|D|s|df
me011|a lot of it's dominated by channel properties.|S|s|s
mn017|exactly.|S|s|aa
fe016|but what you do want to do is take the even if it's klugey take the segments the synchronous segments the ones from the h l t paper where only that speaker was talking.|S|s|s
mn017|so you want to|D|s|s
fe016|use those for adaptation.|S|s|s
fe016|because if you if you use everything then you get all the cross talk in the adaptation and it's just sort of blurred.|S|s|df
mn017|that's a good point.|S|s|ba
mn017|yep.|B|b|b
me018|if you|D|s|s
fe016|and that we know i mean we have that.|S|s|s
fe016|and it's about roughly two thirds i mean very roughly averaged.|S|s|s
mn017|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|that's not completely negligible.|S|s|s
mn017|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so.|S|s|s
me011|cool.|S|s|s
me011|i thought it was higher than that that's|D|s|s
fe016|it really it depends a lot.|S|s|s
fe016|this is just sort of an overall.|S|s|s
mn017|so|F|fh|fh
me013|well i know what we're not turning in to eurospeech.|S|s|s
me013|a redo of the h l t paper.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me013|that i don't want to do that.|S|s|s
me011|yeah i'm doing that for avios.|S|s|s
me013|but|F|fh|fh
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|but i think we're oh morgan's talk went very well i think.|S|s|ba
me013|bleep.|S|s|j
me011|uh bleep.|S|s|j
me011|yeah really.|S|s|j
fe016|i think morgan's talk went very well it woke|D|s|s
fe008|excellent.|S|s|ba
fe016|you know it was really a well presented and got people laughing.|S|s|s
mn017|some good jokes in it?|Q|qy|d
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|especially the batteried meter popping up.|S|s|s
me011|that was hilarious.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right when you were talking about that.|S|s|s
me013|you know that that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged.|S|s|s
me011|it's full.|S|s|m
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
fe008|you said speaking about energy or something.|S|s|s
me011|but that was funny.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|rt
me011|he he he was onto the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand held and trying to get lower power and so on.|S|s|s
fe008|that was very nice.|S|s|ba
mn017|low power.|S|s|s
me011|and microsoft pops up a little window saying your batteries are now fully charged.|S|s|s
fe008|that's great.|S|s|ba
me013|yeah yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i'm thinking about scripting that for my talk you know put put a little script in there to say your batteries are low right when i'm saying that.|S|s|j
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|no i mean in in your case i mean you were joking about it but i mean your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences it's not|D|fg|fg
me013|these are conferences that have really different emphases.|S|s|s
me013|where as h l t and and eurospeech pretty pretty pretty similar so i i i can't see really just putting in the same thing.|S|s|s
me011|are too close.|S|s|2
me011|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe016|no i i don't think that paper is really|D|s|s
me013|but|F|fg|fg
fe016|the h l t paper is really more of a introduction to the project paper and um|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|rt
me011|yeah for eurospeech we want some results.|S|s|s
me011|if we can get them.|S|s|e
fe016|well yeah it it's probably wouldn't make sense.|S|s|s
me013|or some or some|D|%|%
fe016|but|F|fh|fh
me013|i mean i would see eurospeech if we have some eurospeech papers these will be paper uh submissions.|S|s|s
me013|these will be things that are particular things.|S|s|s
me013|aspects of it that we're looking at rather than you know attempt at a global paper about it.|S|s|s
me011|detail.|S|s|2
fe016|right right.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|overall.|S|s|rt
fe008|i did go through one of these meetings.|S|s|s
fe008|i had uh one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the uh n s a meetings.|S|s|s
fe008|and then i went through afterwards and double checked it.|S|s|s
fe008|so that one is really very very accurate.|S|s|s
fe016|oh!|S|s|fe
fe008|i i mentioned the link.|S|s|s
fe016|oh.|S|s|bk
fe008|i sent you know that one?|Q|qy|rt
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
me001|the which one?|Q|qw|rt
me001|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fe008|um i'm trying to remember.|S|h|h
me011|those are all|D|%|%
fe008|i don't remember the number off hand.|S|s|no
fe008|it's one of the n s a's.|S|s|s
fe008|i sent e mail before the conference before last week.|S|s|s
me001|oh okay.|S|s|bk
fe016|that might might have been the one one of the ones that we did.|S|s|s
fe008|what i mean is wednesday thursday.|S|s|bsc
me001|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|i'm sure that that one's accurate.|S|s|s
fe008|i've been through it myself.|S|s|df
me001|okay.|S|s|bk
fe016|so that might actually be useful but they're all non native speakers.|S|s|s
mn017|so we could compare before and after.|S|s|cs
mn017|and see|D|%|%
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah that's what i was going to say.|S|fg|fg
me001|yeah that's the problem with the n s a speakers.|S|s|s
mn017|oh darn!|S|s|fe
me011|the problem with those they're all german.|S|s|s
fe016|and and and extremely hard to follow like word wise.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fg|fg
me001|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|i bet the i mean i have no idea what they're talking about.|S|s|s
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|i corrected it for a number of the words.|S|s|s
fe016|um|F|fh|fh
fe008|i'm sure that um they're they're accurate now.|S|s|s
mn017|uh actually i have to to go.|S|fg|fg
fe016|i mean this is tough for a language model probably.|S|s|s
fe016|it's|D|%|%
me001|right.|S|s|aa
fe016|but but that might be useful just for speech.|S|fh|fh
me013|well|B|b|b
me011|okay andreas is leaving leaving the building.|S|s|tc
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|see ya.|S|s|s
me013|see ya.|S|s|s
me011|um oh before you go|D|h|h
me013|i don't think we'll go much longer.|S|s|s
me011|i guess it's all right for you to talk a little without the mike.|S|s|s
me011|i noticed you adjusting the mike a lot.|S|s|s
me011|did it not fit you well?|Q|qy|rt
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
fe008|well i i noticed when you turned your head it would it would tilt.|S|s|s
me011|maybe it wasn't just tightened enough or|D|s|cs
fe016|maybe the yeah the thing that you have tightened a bit.|S|s|cs
me018|actually if if you have a larger head that mike's got to go farther away which means the the balance is going to make it want to tip down.|S|fg|fg
fe016|oh.|S|s|bk
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|anyway.|S|s|tc
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|because i'm just thinking you know we were we're we've been talking about changing the mikes uh for a while.|S|s|df
me013|see ya.|S|s|s
me001|i was just|D|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|and if these aren't|D|s|s
me011|acoustically they seem really good.|S|s|s
me011|but if they're not comfortable we have the same problems we have with these stupid things.|S|s|s
fe008|i think it's|D|s|s
fe008|this is the first time i've worn this.|S|s|s
fe008|i find it very comfortable.|S|s|s
me011|i find it very comfortable too but uh it looked like andreas was having problems.|S|s|s
me011|and i think morgan was saying it|D|s|s
me013|well but i had it on i had it on this morning and it was fine.|S|h|h
me018|can i see that?|Q|qy|rt
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
me011|oh you did wear it this morning?|Q|qy|rt
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|okay it's off so you can put it on.|S|s|t3
me018|i yeah i don't want it on.|S|s|t3
me018|i just i just want to um say what i think is a problem with this.|S|s|s
me018|if you are wearing this over your ears and you've got it all the way out here.|S|s|rt
me018|then the balance is going to want to pull it this way.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me018|where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here|D|s|s
me011|it's more balanced.|S|s|2
me018|right?|Q|qy|d
fe016|so we have to|D|s|s
fe008|oh!|S|s|fe
me018|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me018|then it then it falls back this way so it's|D|s|s
me011|well what it's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown.|S|fg|fg
me011|and so that should be should be|D|s|s
me011|if it's right against your head there which is what it's supposed to be that balances it.|S|s|s
fe008|uh.|B|b|b
me011|so it doesn't slide up.|S|s|s
me018|so this is supposed to be under that little protuberance.|S|s|bu
me011|yep right right below|D|s|aa
me011|if you feel the back of your head you feel a little lump.|S|s|bu
me011|um and so it's supposed to be right under that.|S|fh|fh
me018|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|so it's really supposed to go more like this than like this.|S|s|bu
me011|yes exactly.|S|s|aa
me018|but then isn't that going to|D|qy|qy
me011|that that that tilts.|S|s|s
me018|well i guess you can control that.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|in lots and lots of different ways.|S|s|s
fe016|so i'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize.|S|s|j
me011|about heads?|Q|qy|2
fe016|but does seem uh|D|s|s
me018|it would be an advantage.|S|s|s
fe008|well wonder if it's if if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair.|S|fg|fg
me013|well we should we we should work on compressing the heads and|D|s|cs
me011|i think probably it was|D|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|it probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head.|S|s|s
me011|i mean so the directions do talk about bending it to your size which is not really what we want.|S|s|rt
me018|the other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back.|S|s|j
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|right.|S|s|aa
me013|that's good.|S|s|ba
fe008|what did you say?|Q|qw|br
fe016|a little|D|%|%
me013|hang a five pound weight off the off the back.|S|s|j
me011|we did that.|S|s|s
fe016|um|F|h|h
me018|hang a five pound weight off the back.|S|s|j
me011|we at boeing i used i was doing augmented reality so they had head mounts on.|S|s|s
me013|weight.|S|s|r
me011|and we we had a little jury rigged one with a welder's helmet.|S|s|s
me018|counter balance.|S|s|2
me011|and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it as a counter balance.|S|s|s
me013|or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people.|S|s|cs
me013|if people those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something.|S|s|cs
me011|yeah!|B|b|b
me013|and|F|fh|fh
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me011|anyway.|F|fg|fg
me013|um so uh what was i going to say?|Q|fg|fg
me013|oh yeah i was going to say uh i had these uh conversations with nist folks also while i was there.|S|s|s
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me013|and and uh um so they they have their their plan for a room uh with um mikes in the middle of the table and uh close mounted mikes.|S|s|s
me013|and they're talking about close mounted and lapels just because they're|D|s|s
fe016|and arrays.|S|s|2
me011|and arrays.|S|s|aa
me013|and the array.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah so they were|D|s|s
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
fe016|which is the interesting|D|s|s
me011|and cameras.|S|s|s
fe016|and video right.|S|s|aa
me013|and yeah like multiple multiple video cameras covering every everybody every place in the room.|S|s|s
me013|uh the yeah the the mikes in the middle the head mounted mikes the lapel mikes the array uh with|D|fh|fh
me013|well there's some discussion of fifty nine.|S|s|s
me011|fifty nine elements.|S|s|bc
me013|they might go down to fifty seven.|S|s|s
me013|because uh there is uh some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a kemar head.|S|s|df
fe016|uhhuh.|B|b|rt
me013|i forget what kemar uh stands for.|S|s|s
me013|but what it is is it's dummy head that is very specially designed.|S|s|s
me011|oh that's right.|S|s|bk
me011|yep.|B|b|b
fe016|right.|B|b|b
me013|and and and so what they're actually doing is they're really there's really two recording systems.|S|s|s
fe016|that's a great idea.|S|s|ba
me013|so they may not be precisely synchronous but but there's two two recording systems.|S|s|s
me013|one with i think twenty four channels and one with sixty four channels.|S|s|e
me013|and the sixty four channel one is for the array.|S|s|e
me013|but they've got some empty channels there.|S|s|s
me013|and anyway they like they're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the kemar head if they go go with that.|S|fh|fh
me011|right.|B|b|b
me011|yeah it is a good idea.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah uh jonathan fiscus did say that uh they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
fe016|uhhuh.|B|b|rt
me011|and that they've found that's just not a big deal.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah i'm not too worried about that.|S|s|s
me013|i was thinking.|S|s|s
fe016|but they're still planning to do like fake|D|s|s
me011|scenario based.|S|s|2
fe016|they have to do something like that.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|their their legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise.|S|s|s
fe016|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but it sounded like they were pretty well thought out.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah that's true.|S|s|aa
me011|and they're they're going to be real meetings.|S|s|s
me011|it's just that they're with with people who would not be meeting otherwise.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|rt
fe016|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|did did they give a talk on this or was this informal?|Q|qr|qr
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me011|no.|S|s|ar
fe016|no.|S|s|ar
me011|it's just informal.|S|s|s
me013|no we just had some discussions various discussions with them.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah i also sat and chatted with several of the nist folks.|S|s|s
me011|they seemed like a good group.|S|s|s
me018|what was the um the paper by um lori lamel that you mentioned?|Q|qw|qw
me013|um yeah we we should just have you have you read it but i uh we've all got these little proceedings.|S|h|h
fe008|huh yeah.|F|h|h
me013|but um basically it was about um uh going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else and adapting and how well that works.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh so in in fact it was pretty related to what liz and andreas did uh except that this was not with meeting stuff it was with|D|fh|fh
me011|right.|B|b|b
me013|uh like i think they didn't they start off with broadcast news system?|Q|fh|fh
me011|their broadcast news was their acoustic models.|S|s|na
me013|and then they went to|D|s|rt
me011|and then all the other tasks were much simpler.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so they were command and control and that sort of thing.|S|s|rt
me013|t i digits was one of them and uh wall street journal.|S|s|rt
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me018|what was their rough what was their conclusion?|Q|qw|rt
me011|yeah read wall street journal.|S|s|rt
me011|it works.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|well it's it's a good paper i mean.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah that was one of the ones that i liked.|S|s|s
fe016|bring the|D|%|%
me011|that it not only works in some cases it was better.|S|s|s
me011|which i thought was pretty interesting.|S|s|s
me011|but that's because they didn't control for parameters.|S|s|df
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me011|you know the broadcast news nets were not nets.|S|s|s
me013|probably.|S|s|am
fe016|right.|B|b|b
me011|acoustic models were a lot more complex.|S|s|s
me018|did they ever try going going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks?|Q|qr|qr
me011|not in that paper.|S|s|nd
me018|or|D|qrr|qrr
me013|that might be hard.|S|s|s
me011|yeah well one of the big problems with that is is often the simpler task isn't fully doesn't have all the phones in it.|S|fg|fg
me011|and that that makes it very hard.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but i've done the same thing.|S|s|s
me011|i've been using broadcast news nets for digits.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|like for the speech proxy thing that i did.|S|s|f
me011|that's what i did.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|sure.|B|b|b
me011|so it works.|S|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah and they have i mean they have better adaptation than we had than that that system.|S|fg|fg
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me013|so they|D|%|%
me013|um|F|h|h
me011|you mean they have some.|S|s|bc
me013|yeah we should probably what would|D|s|cs
me013|actually what we should do uh i haven't said anything about this.|S|s|s
me013|but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that uh you know got our interest.|S|s|cs
me013|and we should go around the room at one of the tuesday lunch meetings and say you know what what was good about the conference.|S|s|cc
me011|present.|S|s|2
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me011|do a trip report.|S|s|2
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|well the summarization stuff was interesting.|S|s|s
fe016|i mean i don't know anything about that field.|S|s|bd
fe016|but for this proposal on meeting summarization|D|s|s
fe016|um i mean it's sort of a far cry.|S|fh|fh
fe016|because they weren't working with meeting type data.|S|s|df
fe016|but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
me018|do you remember who the groups were that we're doing?|Q|qy|rt
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
fe016|well there're|D|s|s
me011|a lot of different ones.|S|s|s
fe016|this was the last day.|S|s|s
fe008|i think|D|s|s
fe016|but i mean there's that's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|i i don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference.|S|s|s
me018|was were there folks from b b n presenting?|Q|qy|rt
fe016|but|D|%|%
fe016|yet there was let's see this was on the last day mitre b b n and um prager.|S|s|s
me011|mitre b b n i b m.|S|s|s
me011|uh|F|h|h
fe008|maryland?|Q|qy|d
fe016|um i it was|D|fg|fg
me013|columbia have anything?|Q|qy|d
me013|no.|S|s|ar
fe016|no it was|D|s|ar
me011|wasn't who who who did the order one?|Q|qw|qw
fe016|this was wednesday morning.|S|s|s
fe016|the sentence ordering one was that barselou and these guys?|Q|qy|rt
me011|ugh ! i'm just so bad at that.|S|h|h
fe008|oh.|B|b|b
fe016|anyway i i it's in the program.|S|s|s
fe016|i should have read it to remind myself.|S|s|s
fe016|but that's sort of useful.|S|fh|fh
fe016|and i think like when mari and katrin and jeff are here it'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts.|S|s|cs
fe016|because we already have|D|s|df
me011|yeah we do have word transcripts.|S|s|2
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|you know.|B|b|b
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|well i like the idea that adam had of of um maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have.|S|s|cs
fe008|because it would be easy to to to do that.|S|s|s
fe008|just you know|D|%|%
fe016|right.|B|b|b
fe008|and and|F|fh|fh
fe008|it has to be though someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing.|S|s|s
me011|someone who actually does take notes.|S|s|j
me011|um i'm very bad at note taking.|S|s|t3
fe016|but i think what's interesting is there's all these different evaluations like just you know how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not.|S|s|s
me011|i always write down the wrong things.|S|s|t3
fe008|i do take notes.|S|s|t3
fe016|and that's what's was sort of interesting to me is that there's different ways to do it.|S|s|s
me011|a judge.|S|s|2
fe016|and|F|fh|fh
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me018|was s r a one of the groups talking about summarization no?|Q|qy|rt
fe016|huh huh.|S|s|ar
fe016|no.|S|s|ar
fe008|it was an interesting session.|S|s|ba
me011|and as i said i like the microsoft talk on scaling issues in uh word sense disambiguation.|S|s|s
fe008|one of those|D|s|s
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|that was interesting.|S|s|ba
me013|yeah that was an interesting discussion.|S|s|ba
me011|the|D|%|%
me013|uh i|D|fh|fh
me011|it it it was the only one it was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about.|S|s|s
fe016|the data issue comes up all the|D|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|well i didn't have as much disagreement as i would have liked.|S|s|ng
me013|but i didn't want to i i didn't want to get into it because uh you know it was the application was one i didn't know anything about.|S|s|e
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me013|uh so it just would have been you know me getting up to be argumentative.|S|fh|fh
me013|but but uh|F|fh|fh
me013|i mean the missing|D|s|s
me013|so so what they were saying it's one of these things is you know all you need is more data sort of.|S|fh|fh
me013|but i it that's that's dissing it uh improperly.|S|s|s
me013|i mean it was a nice study.|S|s|s
me013|uh they were doing this it wasn't word sense disambiguation it was|D|fh|fh
fe016|yeah yeah yeah|D|s|ar
me011|well it sort of was.|S|fg|fg
me013|was it was it word sense?|Q|qy|rt
me011|but it was it was a very simple case of to versus too versus two and there their they're.|S|s|s
me013|yes.|S|s|bk
fe016|and there and their and|D|s|s
me013|yeah yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
fe016|and that you could do better with more data i mean that's clearly statistically|D|s|s
me013|right.|F|fg|fg
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and so what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines and they had different amounts of data.|S|fg|fg
me013|and so they did like you know eight different methods that everybody you know uh argues about about oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine.|S|s|s
me013|and uh they were started off with a million words that they used.|S|fh|fh
me013|which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using.|S|s|e
me013|so they went up being microsoft they went up to a billion.|S|s|s
me013|and then they had this log scale showing a|D|s|s
me013|you know and and naturally everything gets|D|fh|fh
me011|them being beep they went off to a billion.|S|s|j
me013|they|D|%|%
me013|well it's a big company.|S|s|s
me013|yeah i didn't i didn't mean it as a anything negative.|S|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|but|D|%|%
fe016|you mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training?|Q|qy|bu
me011|well i think the reason they can do that is that they assumed that text that they get off the web like from wall street journal is correct and edit it.|S|fg|fg
me011|so that's what they used as training data.|S|s|df
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|it's just saying if it's in this corpus it's correct.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|but i mean yes.|S|s|s
me013|of course there was the kind of effect that you know one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data.|S|s|s
me013|um but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place.|S|fh|fh
me013|and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines.|S|s|s
me013|and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me018|this was my concern about the recognizer in aurora.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|that|D|qw|d
me018|that the differences we're seeing in the front end is|D|s|m
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|are irrelevant.|S|s|2
me018|are irrelevant.|S|s|aa
me018|once you get a real recognizer at the back end.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|if you add more data?|Q|qy|rt
fe016|or|D|qrr|qrr
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|you know?|Q|qy|d
fe016|huh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|could well be.|S|s|am
me013|so so i mean that was that was kind of you know it's a good point.|S|fh|fh
me013|but the problem i had with it was that the implications out of this was that uh the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant.|S|s|s
me013|which is not at as for as i know in in tasks i'm more familiar with is not at all true.|S|s|s
me013|what what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties.|S|s|s
me013|and you want to know what those properties are.|S|s|s
me013|and someone else sort of implied that well we you know all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are.|S|s|s
me013|we don't know them perfectly but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation.|S|s|rt
me013|and some are are have limited kind of discrimination but are just easy to use and others are|D|s|s
me018|but doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started?|Q|qy|bu
me018|because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better.|S|s|df
me013|you would guess|D|s|s
me018|as you approach there's a point where you can't get any better.|S|s|s
me018|right?|Q|qy|d
me018|you get everything right.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe016|it's just no|D|s|s
me011|but|D|fg|fg
me011|no but there was still a spread.|S|s|ar
me018|so they're all approaching.|S|s|s
me011|they weren't all|D|s|nd
me011|they weren't converging.|S|s|bc
me011|they were all still spread.|S|s|df
me013|it|D|%|%
me018|but what i'm saying is that they have to as they all get better they have to get closer together.|S|s|df
me011|but they|D|%|%
me011|right right.|S|s|aa
me011|sure.|S|s|aa
me011|but they hadn't even come close to that point.|S|s|df
me011|all the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|am
me018|but they're all going the same way.|S|s|s
me018|right?|Q|qy|d
me018|so you have to get closer.|S|s|df
me013|eventually.|S|s|s
me013|one would|D|s|s
me011|but they didn't get closer.|S|s|nd
me018|oh they didn't.|S|s|bk
me011|they just switched position.|S|s|df
me013|well|F|h|h
me013|well that's getting|D|s|s
me013|i mean|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah the spread was still pretty wide that's that's true.|S|s|aap
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me013|but but uh i think it would be intuition that this would be the case.|S|s|df
me013|but uh to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different.|S|s|s
me013|i mean i think somebody let's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in switchboard than it is in in broadcast news.|S|fh|fh
fe016|well it's different for different tasks.|S|s|na
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|it was liz.|D|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|so it depends a lot on whether you know it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better.|S|s|s
fe016|right?|Q|qy|d
fe016|you're you're you can assume similar distributions.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|rt
fe016|but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of uh test data then your training data then that extra data wouldn't generalize.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
me013|right.|B|b|b
me011|but i think one of their they they had a couple points.|S|s|s
me011|uh i think one of them was that well maybe simpler algorithms and more data are is better.|S|fh|fh
me011|less memory.|S|s|s
me011|faster operation.|S|s|s
me011|simpler.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|because their simplest most brain dead algorithm did pretty darn well.|S|s|s
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|when you got gave it a lot more data.|S|s|e
me011|and then also they were saying well you have access to a lot more data.|S|s|s
me011|why are you sticking with a million words?|Q|qw|qw
me011|i mean their point was that this million word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old.|S|s|s
me011|and everyone is still using it.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|but anyway i i i think it's it's just the the it's it's it's not really the conclusion they came to so much as the conclusion that some of the uh uh commenters in the crowd came up with.|D|s|tc
me011|but we could talk about this stuff.|S|s|cs
me011|i think this would be fun to do.|S|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|rt
me011|right.|D|b|b
me013|that uh you know this therefore is further evidence that you know more data is really all you should care about.|S|s|s
me013|and that i thought was just kind of going too far the other way.|S|s|s
me011|machine learning.|S|s|2
me013|and and the the uh|D|%|%
me013|one one person got up and made a a brief defense.|S|s|s
me013|uh but it was a different kind of grounds.|S|fh|fh
me013|it was that that uh the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important but in fact they didn't have it available.|S|s|s
me013|um but the other point to make again is that uh machine learning still does matter.|S|fh|fh
me013|but it it matters more in some situations than in others.|S|s|rt
me013|and it and also there's there's not just mattering or not mattering but there's mattering in different ways.|S|s|s
me013|i mean you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you're using.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
me013|or you care you know what recall time is.|S|s|s
me013|or you care you know and and|D|s|s
me011|or you only have a million words for your some new task.|S|s|e
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|or or uh|D|%|%
fe016|or done another language or|D|s|s
me011|yep.|B|b|b
fe016|i mean you so there's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah blah blah.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe016|and then there's people saying oh just add more data.|S|s|e
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
me013|and there's cost.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe016|these are like two different religions basically.|S|s|s
me011|cost.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|there's just plain cost.|S|s|r
me011|that's a big one.|S|s|s
me013|you know?|Q|qh|qh
me013|so so these i mean the in the in the speech side the thing that always occurs to me is that if you|D|fh|fh
me013|if you uh|D|%|%
me013|one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on and the other only requires a hundred.|S|s|s
me013|and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter.|S|s|s
me013|that's that's going to be better.|S|s|ba
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me013|because people i mean there isn't going to be just one system that people train on.|S|s|df
me013|and then that's it for the for all of time.|S|s|s
me013|i mean people are going to be doing other different things and so it these these things matters matter.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah that's it.|S|s|aa
fe008|so i mean this was a very provocative slide.|S|s|s
me011|yeah so that's one of the slides they put up.|S|s|s
fe008|she put this up and it was like this is this people kept saying can i see that slide again.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|yeah.|B|b|rt
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and then they'd make a comment and one person said a well known person said um you know before you dismiss forty five years including my work.|S|s|s
me011|forty five years of research.|S|s|2
me001|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|yeah.|B|b|b
fe016|but you know the same thing has happened in computational linguistics.|S|s|s
fe016|right?|Q|qy|d
fe016|you look at the a c l papers coming out and now there's sort of a turn back towards okay we've learned statistic|D|s|s
fe016|you know we're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods.|S|s|s
fe016|and|F|fh|fh
fe016|you know there's arguments on both sides.|S|s|s
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me011|i think the matters is the thing that that was misleading.|S|s|s
fe016|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|that was a very offending.|S|s|s
fe016|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|very offending.|S|s|r
me011|is that all all of them are based on all the others.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|just you you can't say|D|s|s
me013|right.|S|s|aa
me018|maybe they should have said focus or something.|S|s|cs
me011|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me011|i mean so|F|fh|fh
me011|and i'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qh|qh
me011|for a long time people were coding linguistic rules.|S|s|s
me011|and then they discovered machine learning worked better.|S|s|e
me011|and now they're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about uh the exact details of the algorithms.|S|s|s
fe016|and and then you hit this|D|s|s
me011|except when they have a eurospeech paper.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|anyway.|F|fh|fh
me013|anyway.|F|fh|fh
me011|shall we read some digits?|Q|qy|cs
me013|tea is tea is uh starting.|S|s|s
me011|are we going to do one at a time or should we read them all at once again?|Q|qr|qr
me013|let's do it all at once.|S|s|cc
me013|we let's try that again.|S|s|cc
fe016|yes.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah that's good.|S|s|aa
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
fe016|so and maybe we won't laugh this time also.|S|s|s
me011|so remember to read the transcript number so that uh everyone knows that what it is.|S|s|cc
me011|and ready?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|yeah.|S|s|s
me011|three two one.|S|s|s
