me013|so you think we're going now.|S|s|s
me013|yes?|Q|qy|d
me013|okay good.|S|s|s
me013|all right.|F|fg|fg
me013|going again.|S|s|s
me013|uh so we're going to go around as before and uh do do our digits.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh yeah you don't actually need to say the name.|S|fh|fh
me013|that'll probably be bleeped out.|S|s|t3
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|that's if these are anonymized.|S|s|s
me013|but yeah|F|fh|fh
me006|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me013|uh i mean not that there's anything defamatory about uh eight five seven or or anything.|S|fh|fh
me013|but|F|fh|fh
me013|uh anyway.|S|fh|fh
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|uh so here's what i have for i i was just jotting down things i think that we should do today.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh this is what i have for an agenda so far.|S|fh|fh
me013|um we should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh a number of us are doing a field trip to uh uh o g i.|S|fh|fh
me013|and uh mostly first though about the logistics for it.|S|fh|fh
me013|then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know might accomplish.|S|s|co
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|uh in and kind of go around see what people have been doing talk about that a progress report um essentially.|S|fh|fh
me013|um and then uh another topic i had was that uh uh uh dave here had uh said uh give me something to do.|S|fh|fh
me013|and i i have i have uh failed so far in doing that.|S|s|s
me013|and so maybe we can discuss that a little bit.|S|s|co
me013|if we find some holes in some things that that someone could use some help with he's he's volunteering to help.|S|s|s
me018|i've got to move a bunch of furniture.|S|s|j
me013|okay always count on a serious comment from that corner.|S|s|bk
me013|so um|F|fh|fh
me013|uh and uh then uh talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that's starting to get worked out.|S|fh|fh
me013|and then anything else anybody has that isn't in that list?|Q|qo|d
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me026|i was just wondering does this mean the battery's dying and i should change it?|Q|qy|rt
me013|uh i think that means the battery's okay.|S|h|h
me013|d do you|D|%|%
me018|let me see.|S|s|co
me026|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me026|so|F|fh|fh
me018|yeah that's good.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|you're all right.|S|s|s
me026|because it's full.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me026|all right.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|it looks full of electrons.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
me013|plenty of electrons left there.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
me013|so um|F|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me013|so uh i wanted to start this with this mundane thing.|S|fh|fh
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|uh i i it was it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning.|S|s|s
me013|um.|F|fh|fh
me006|oh yeah that's right.|S|s|bk
me013|uh this is uh the reason i did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a of a visit.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so um the issue is how how how would we ever accomplish that?|Q|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|what what what part of town do you live in?|Q|qw|rt
me006|um i live in um the corner of campus.|S|h|h
me006|the um southeast corner.|S|s|e
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|okay so would it be easier|D|fg|fg
me013|those of you who are not you know used to this area it can be very tricky to get to the airport at at uh you know six thirty.|S|s|s
me013|um so would it be easier for you if you came here and i drove you?|Q|fh|fh
me013|yeah?|Q|qy|d
mn007|yeah perhaps yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah yeah okay.|S|s|bk
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|yeah sure.|S|s|aa
me013|okay so if if everybody can get here at six.|S|fg|fg
fn002|at six.|S|s|m
me013|yeah i'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time.|S|s|aa
me006|six okay.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah so.|F|fh|fh
me013|oh boy!|S|s|fe
me013|anyway.|F|fg|fg
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me018|will that be enough time?|Q|qy|rt
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah so i'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front.|S|s|cc
me013|and uh and yeah that'll be plenty of time.|S|fh|fh
me013|it'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day.|S|s|s
me013|and and uh|F|fh|fh
me018|i guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst.|S|s|s
me013|going to oakland.|S|s|nd
me034|yeah oakland.|S|s|nd
me006|oakland.|S|s|nd
me018|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|bridge.|S|s|s
me018|once you get past the turnoff to the bay bridge.|S|s|s
me013|oh the turnoff to the bridge.|S|s|bk
me018|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|won't even do that.|S|s|nd
me013|i mean just go down martin luther king.|S|s|s
me034|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|and then martin luther king to nine eighty to eight eighty.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and it's it'd take us tops uh thirty minutes to get there.|S|s|s
me018|oh i|B|b|b
me013|so that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane.|S|s|s
me013|it'll just|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|great.|S|s|ba
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me013|so that'll|D|s|s
me013|it's i mean it's still not going to be really easy.|S|s|s
me013|but well particularly for for uh for barry and me.|S|s|s
me013|we're not we're not staying overnight.|S|s|s
me013|so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for uh a pad of paper.|S|s|s
me013|and so and uh you two have to bring a little bit.|S|fh|fh
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|but uh you know don't don't bring a footlocker and we'll be okay.|S|fh|fh
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|you're staying overnight.|S|s|s
me006|so just|D|%|%
me013|i figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase.|S|s|s
mn007|oh yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|that's sort of one night.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|anyway.|F|fh|fh
me006|so six a m in front.|S|s|bu
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me013|six a m in front.|S|s|s
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|uh i'll be here.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh i'll i'll i'll i'll give you my phone number.|S|fh|fh
me013|if i'm not here for a few after a few minutes then|D|s|j
me006|wake you up.|S|s|cs
me013|nah i'll be fine.|S|s|s
me013|i just uh it for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than i usually do.|S|s|s
me013|not not not a lot.|S|s|s
me006|okay wednesday.|D|s|bk
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me013|that was the real real important stuff.|S|s|s
me013|um i i i figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh until we talk about what's been going on.|S|fh|fh
me013|so uh what's been going on?|Q|fh|fh
me013|why don't we start start over here.|S|s|cs
mn007|um well preparation of the french test data actually.|S|h|h
me013|okay.|B|b|b
mn007|so it means that um|D|s|s
mn007|well it is uh a digit french database of microphone speech.|S|s|s
mn007|downsampled to eight kilohertz.|S|s|s
mn007|i've added noise to one part with the actually the aurora two noises.|S|s|rt
mn007|and so this is a training part.|S|s|s
mn007|and then the remaining part i use for testing and with other kind of noises.|S|s|s
mn007|so we can.|S|s|s
mn007|so this is almost ready.|S|s|rt
mn007|i'm preparing the the h t k baseline for this task.|S|s|s
mn007|and yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so the h t k base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on.|S|s|s
me013|or|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah okay.|F|fh|fh
me013|and again i guess the the plan is uh to uh then given this|D|s|s
me013|what's the plan again?|Q|qw|rt
mn007|the plan with these data?|Q|qy|bu
me013|with|D|%|%
me013|so so does just remind me of what what you were going to do with the what what what what's|D|s|co
me013|you just described what you've been doing.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|so if you could remind me of what you're going to be doing.|S|s|co
me013|oh this is|D|%|%
mn007|uh yeah.|S|h|h
me013|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me006|tell him about the cube.|S|s|co
mn007|the cube.|S|s|bk
mn007|i should tell him about the cube.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|oh cube yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|uh we actually we want to huh uh uh analyze three dimensions.|S|s|s
fn002|fill in the cube.|S|s|co
mn007|the feature dimension the training data dimension and the test data dimension.|S|s|e
mn007|um|F|fh|fh
mn007|well what we want to do is first we have number for each uh task.|S|s|s
mn007|so we have the um t i digit task the italian task the french task and the finnish task.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|so we have numbers with uh systems i mean i mean neural networks trained on the task data.|S|s|rt
mn007|and then to have systems with neural networks trained on uh data from the same language if possible with well using a more generic database which is phonetically phonetically balanced.|S|s|s
mn007|and um.|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah so|D|%|%
me013|so we had talked i guess we had talked at one point about maybe the language i d corpus.|S|s|s
me013|is that a possibility for that?|Q|qy|rt
mn007|uh yeah but uh these corpus there is a call home and a call friend also.|S|s|aa
mn007|the call friend is for language identification.|S|s|e
mn007|well anyway these corpus are all telephone speech.|S|s|s
mn007|so um this could be a a problem for why?|Q|qw|d
mn007|because uh uh the the speech dat databases are not telephone speech.|S|s|s
mn007|they are downsampled to eight kilohertz.|S|s|s
mn007|but but they are not uh with telephone bandwidth.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|that's really funny.|S|s|s
me013|isn't it?|Q|qy|g
me013|i mean because th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone.|S|s|df
me006|telephone.|S|s|2
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the|D|s|bk
mn007|well you do not send speech you send features computed on the the device.|S|s|s
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah i know.|S|s|bk
me013|but the reason|D|s|s
mn007|or well.|F|fh|fh
me013|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me013|so your point is that it's it's it's uh the features are computed locally and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth uh or telephone distortions.|S|s|bu
mn007|so you|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|did you happen to find out anything about the o g i multilingual database?|Q|qy|rt
me013|yeah that's that's that's what i meant.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah it's|D|s|aa
me013|i said there's there's there's an o g i language i d not the not the uh|D|s|s
me013|the callfriend is a is a uh l d c thing right?|S|s|bu
mn007|yeah there are also two other databases.|S|s|aa
mn007|one they call the multi language database and another one is a twenty two language something like that.|S|s|e
mn007|but it's also telephone speech.|S|s|e
me018|oh they are?|Q|qy|bh
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|well nnn|F|fg|fg
me013|but i'm not sure|D|s|s
mn007|so|D|%|%
me013|i mean the bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue.|S|s|bu
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|because this is downsampled and and filtered.|S|s|s
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so it's just the fact that it's not telephone.|S|s|s
me013|and there are so many other differences between these different databases.|S|s|s
me013|i mean some of this stuff's recorded in the car.|S|s|s
me013|and some of it's|D|s|s
me013|i mean there's there's many different acoustic differences.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so i'm not sure if i mean unless we're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database i'm not sure if it's completely rules it out.|S|s|no
me013|if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there's going to be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse to sort of add another mismatch if you will?|Q|qy|qy
me013|uh i i guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh in there.|S|fh|fh
mn007|yeah but uhhuh um|D|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|well actually for the moment if we do not want to use these phone databases we we already have uh english spanish and french uh with microphone speech.|S|s|cs
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|so|F|fh|fh
me013|so that's what you're thinking of using is sort of the the equivalent of the multiple?|Q|qy|d
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases.|S|s|na
me013|and for the difference in phonetic context that you provide that.|S|s|s
mn007|well this|D|%|%
mn007|uh actually these three databases are um generic databases.|S|h|h
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|so for for uh italian which is close to spanish french and uh t i digits we have both uh digits training data and also more general training data.|S|s|e
mn007|so huh|F|fh|fh
me013|well we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk which is is microphone data for for english.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah perhaps yeah there is also timit.|S|s|bk
mn007|we could use timit.|S|s|cs
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|right.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah so there's plenty of stuff around.|S|s|bk
me013|okay so anyway the basic plan is to uh test this cube.|S|fg|fg
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yes.|D|%|%
fn002|to fill in the cube.|S|s|bsc
me013|to fill fill it in.|S|s|m
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah and perhaps um we were thinking that perhaps the cross language issue is not uh so big of a issue.|S|fg|fg
mn007|well we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross language stuff.|S|s|cs
mn007|i mean uh training training a net on a language and testing for another language.|S|s|cs
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|but that's|D|%|%
mn007|perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages but uh with a general database general databases.|S|s|cs
mn007|so that well the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained on that language or a generic net.|S|s|df
me013|uh it it depends how you mean using the net.|S|fg|fg
mn007|but not trained on a|D|s|s
me013|so if you're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we're talking about you can't do that.|S|s|nd
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|because because the what they're asking for is is a feature set.|S|s|df
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|and so uh we're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|but if we say no you have to have a different feature set for each language i think this is going to be very bad.|S|s|nd
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me013|so|F|fh|fh
mn007|you think so.|S|s|t3
fn002|oh.|D|%|%
me006|that's|D|s|t3
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah i mean in principle i mean conceptually it's sort of like they want a well they want a replacement for mel cepstra.|S|s|s
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|so we say okay this is the year two thousand.|S|s|s
me013|we've got something much better than mel cepstra.|S|s|s
me013|it's you know gobbledy gook.|S|s|s
me013|okay and so we give them these gobbledy gook features.|S|s|s
me013|but these gobbledy gook features are supposed to be good for any language.|S|s|s
mn007|huh|B|b|b
me013|because you don't know who's going to call.|S|s|df
me013|and you know i mean so it's it's it's uh|D|s|s
me013|uh how do you know what language it is?|Q|fh|fh
me013|somebody picks up the phone.|S|s|s
me013|so this is their image.|S|s|s
mn007|well i chh|D|fg|fg
me013|someone picks up the phone right?|S|s|s
me013|and and he he picks up the|D|s|s
mn007|yeah but the the application is|D|fg|fg
mn007|there is a target language for the application.|S|s|s
mn007|so if a|D|fh|fh
me013|yeah|F|fg|fg
me013|well|F|fh|fh
mn007|well|F|fg|fg
me013|but no but you you pick up the phone.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|you talk on the phone.|S|s|s
me013|and it sends features out.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
me013|so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah .|B|b|b
mn007|if|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|if it's in the phone.|S|s|aap
mn007|but|D|%|%
mn007|well it that that could be at the server's side.|S|s|df
me013|but that's the image that they have.|S|s|df
mn007|and well huh yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|it could be.|S|s|aap
me013|but that's the image they have.|S|s|df
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so that's that's|D|s|s
me013|i mean one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years.|S|s|s
me013|but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it's distributed speech recognition where the uh uh probabilistic part and and semantics and so forth are all on the servers and you compute features of the uh on the phone.|S|s|s
me013|so that's that's what we're involved in.|S|s|s
me013|we might might or might not agree that that's the way it will be in ten years.|S|s|s
me013|but that's that's that's what they're asking for.|S|s|s
me013|so so i think that it is an important issue whether it works cross language.|S|s|s
me013|now it's the o g i uh folks' perspective right now that probably that's not the biggest deal.|S|s|s
me013|and that the biggest deal is the um acoustic environment mismatch.|S|s|s
me013|and they may very well be right.|S|s|s
me013|but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true.|S|s|cs
me013|if that's true we don't need to worry so much.|S|s|s
me013|maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh uh that that that the rest doesn't matter.|S|s|s
me013|um the other thing is uh this notion of training to uh which i i guess they're starting to look at up there training to something more like articulatory features.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh and if you have something that's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across you know a wide range of languages.|S|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|uh but|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah so i don't i know unfortunately i don't i see what you're where you're coming from i think.|S|fh|fh
me013|but i don't think we can ignore it.|S|s|s
mn007|so we we really have to do test with a real cross language.|S|s|s
mn007|i mean for instance training on english and testing on italian.|S|s|e
mn007|or or we can train or else uh can we train a net on uh a range of languages and which can include the test the test the target language.|S|s|cs
me006|test on an unseen.|S|s|t3
mn007|or|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so um|F|fh|fh
me013|there's there's uh|D|s|s
me013|this is complex.|S|s|s
me013|so ultimately uh as i was saying i think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language.|S|s|nd
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|now can you include uh the the target language?|Q|qy|qy
me013|um from a purist's standpoint it'd be nice not to.|S|fh|fh
me013|because then you can say when|D|s|s
me013|because surely someone is going to say at some point okay so you put in the german and the finnish.|S|s|s
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|uh now what do you do uh when somebody has portuguese?|Q|fh|fh
me013|you know?|Q|qy|d
me013|um and uh however you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation.|S|fh|fh
me013|so i would say if it looks like there's a big difference to put it in then we'd make note of it and then we probably put in the other.|S|s|s
me013|because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that you know it's not so bad as long as we we note it and say look we did do this.|S|s|df
mn007|huh?|D|%|%
me018|and so ideally what you'd want to do is you'd want to run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages.|S|s|cs
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah perhaps.|S|s|am
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|and that way you can say well you know we're going to build it for what we think are the most common ones.|S|s|s
me018|but if that somebody uses it with a different language you know here's what's you're here's what's likely to happen.|S|s|s
me013|yeah because the truth is is that it's it's not like there are i mean although there are thousands of languages uh from uh uh the point of view of cellular companies there aren't.|S|fg|fg
me013|there's you know there's fifty or something.|S|s|s
me018|right.|S|s|bk
me013|you know.|F|fh|fh
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|uh and they aren't you know with the exception of finnish which i guess it's pretty different from most most things.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh it's it's uh most of them are like at least some of the others.|S|fh|fh
me013|so our guess that spanish is like italian and and so on.|S|s|s
me013|i guess finnish is a is is a little bit like hungarian supposedly.|S|s|bu
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|or is|D|%|%
me013|i think|D|%|%
me018|i don't know anything about finnish.|S|s|no
me013|well i oh well i know that uh i mean i'm not a linguist but i guess hungarian and finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former soviet union are in this sort of same family.|S|s|s
me013|but they're just these you know uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another have i guess people rode in on horses and brought their|D|s|s
me018|huh.|B|b|b
me018|huh.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
mn007|the|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|your turn.|S|s|co
me006|oh my turn.|S|s|bk
me006|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me006|um let's see i i spent the last week uh looking over stephane's shoulder and and understanding some of the data.|S|h|h
me006|i reinstalled um um h t k the free version.|S|s|s
me006|so um everybody's now using three point o.|S|fh|fh
me006|which is the same version that uh o g i is using.|S|s|e
me013|oh good.|S|s|ba
me006|yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|so|F|fh|fh
me006|without without any licensing big deals or anything like that.|S|s|e
me006|and um so we've been talking about this this uh cube thing.|S|fh|fh
me006|and it's beginning more and more looking like the uh the borge cube thing.|S|s|s
me006|it's really gargantuan.|S|s|e
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|but i'm am i|D|%|%
me013|so are are you going to be assimilated?|Q|qy|j
me018|resistance is futile.|S|s|j
me006|exactly.|S|s|aa
me006|um yeah so i've been looking at uh uh timit stuff.|S|fg|fg
me006|um the the stuff that we've been working on with timit trying to get a um a labels file so we can uh train up a train up a net on timit and test um the difference between this net trained on timit and a net trained on digits alone.|S|fh|fh
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|um and seeing if if it hurts or helps.|S|fh|fh
me013|and again when just to clarify when you're talking about training up a net you're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach?|Q|qy|bu
me006|anyway|D|fh|fh
me006|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me013|and and the inputs are p l p and delta and that sort of thing.|S|s|e
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|well the inputs are one dimension of the cube.|S|s|s
me013|or|D|%|%
me006|which um we've talked about it being uh p l p um m f c cs um j rasta j rasta l d a.|S|s|e
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah but your initial things you're making one choice there.|S|s|bk
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|which is p l p or something?|Q|qy|bu
me006|right.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|um i i haven't i haven't decided on on the initial thing.|S|h|h
me006|probably probably something like p l p.|S|s|na
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fg|fg
me013|so so you take p l p and you you uh do it uh you you uh use h t k with it with the transformed features using a neural net that's trained.|S|fh|fh
me013|and the training could either be from digits itself or from timit.|S|s|bu
me013|and that's the|D|s|s
me006|right.|D|b|b
me013|and and and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language.|S|s|s
me006|right.|D|b|b
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
me006|right.|D|b|b
me013|i i i get in the picture about the cube.|S|s|s
me006|yeah|D|b|b
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me006|maybe.|S|s|am
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|i mean those listening to this will not have a picture either.|S|s|s
me013|so um i guess i'm i'm not any worse off.|S|fh|fh
me013|but|D|%|%
me013|but at some point somebody should just show me the cube.|S|s|cs
me013|it sounds|D|s|s
me013|i i get i think i get the general idea of it.|S|s|s
me006|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|so when you said that you were getting the labels for timit um are what do you mean by that?|Q|qw|qw
me006|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me006|oh i'm just i'm just uh transforming them from the um the standard timit transcriptions into into a nice long huge p file to do training.|S|s|bk
me018|huh.|S|s|bk
me018|were the digits um hand labeled for phones?|Q|qy|rt
me006|um the the digits|D|h|h
me018|or were they those labels automatically derived?|Q|qrr|qrr
me006|oh yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|those were those were automatically derived by by dan using um embedded embedded training and alignment.|S|s|s
me018|huh.|S|s|bk
me013|uh but which dan?|Q|fg|fg
me006|uh ellis.|S|h|h
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me006|right.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|B|b|b
me006|yeah so.|D|%|%
me018|i was just wondering because that test you're|D|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|i i think you're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not uh having general speech performs as well as having specific speech.|S|s|s
me006|that's right.|S|s|aa
me013|well especially when you go over the different languages again.|S|s|na
me013|because you'd the different languages have different words for the different digits.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|and i was|D|s|s
me013|so it's|D|%|%
me018|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|so i was just wondering if the fact that timit you're using the hand labeled stuff from timit might be confuse the results that you get.|S|s|s
me013|i i think it would.|S|s|aa
me013|but but on the other hand it might be better.|S|s|s
me018|right but if it's better it may be better because it was hand labeled.|S|s|bk
me013|oh yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|but still probably use it.|S|s|s
me018|yeah okay.|D|b|b
me013|i mean|F|fg|fg
me013|you know i i i guess i'm sounding cavalier.|S|s|s
me013|but i mean i think the point is you have uh a bunch of labels and and they're hand uh hand marked.|S|s|s
me013|uh i guess actually timit was not entirely hand marked.|S|fh|fh
me013|it was automatically first and then hand hand corrected.|S|s|s
me013|but but um uh it it um it might be a better source.|S|fh|fh
me018|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so it's|D|s|s
me013|you're right.|S|s|aa
me013|it would be another interesting scientific question to ask is it because it's a broad source or because it was you know carefully?|Q|qr|qr
me013|uh and that's something you could ask.|S|fh|fh
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|but given limited time i think the main thing is if it's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system.|S|s|s
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|then it's probably|D|s|s
me018|right.|B|b|b
me018|what about the differences in the phone sets?|Q|qw|qw
me006|uh between languages?|Q|h|h
me018|no between timit and the the digits.|S|s|ar
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|um right.|S|fh|fh
me006|well there's a mapping from the sixty one phonemes in timit to to fifty six the icsi fifty six.|S|s|s
fn002|sixty one.|S|s|t3
me018|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me018|i see.|S|s|bk
me006|and then the digits phonemes um there's about twenty twenty two or twenty four of them.|S|s|rt
me006|is that right?|Q|qy|qy
me018|out of that fifty six?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|yep.|S|s|aa
me006|out of that fifty six.|S|s|m
me018|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me006|yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|so|F|fh|fh
me006|it's it's definitely broader.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|but actually the issue of uh phoneme mappings will arise when we will do use several languages.|S|s|s
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|because you well some phonemes are not uh in every languages.|S|s|s
mn007|so we plan to develop a subset of the phonemes uh that includes uh all the phonemes of our training languages.|S|s|s
mn007|and use a network with kind of one hundred outputs or something like that.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|you mean a superset sort of.|S|s|bu
mn007|uh yeah.|S|h|h
mn007|superset.|S|s|m
me013|yeah yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|yeah.|S|s|bk
fn002|i i looks the sampa phone.|S|s|rt
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|sampa phone for english uh american english and the the the language who have more phone are the english.|S|s|s
me018|huh.|S|s|bk
fn002|of the these language.|S|s|e
fn002|but for example in spain the spanish have several phone that doesn't appear in the english and we thought to complete.|S|s|s
fn002|but for that it needs we must do a lot of work because we need to generate new transcription for the database that we have.|S|s|s
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me034|other than the language is there a reason not to use the timit phone set?|Q|qy|rt
me034|because it's larger.|S|s|e
me034|as opposed to the icsi phone set.|S|s|e
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|you mean why map the sixty one to the fifty six?|Q|qy|bu
me034|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|i don't know.|S|s|no
me006|i have|D|%|%
me013|um i forget if that happened starting with you or was it or if it was eric afterwards who did that.|S|fg|fg
me013|but i think basically there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there.|S|s|s
me018|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|and i think some of them they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning.|S|s|s
me034|oh.|S|s|bk
me018|when really they're both silence.|S|s|s
me018|i i think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty six.|S|s|s
me034|okay.|B|b|b
me013|yeah especially in a system like ours which is a discriminative system.|S|s|bk
me013|you know you're really asking this net to learn.|S|s|s
me034|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|it's it's kind of hard.|S|s|s
me018|there's not much difference really.|S|s|s
me018|and the ones that are gone i think are i think there was they also in timit had like a glottal stop.|S|s|s
me018|which was basically a short period of silence.|S|s|e
me034|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|and so|F|fh|fh
me034|well we have that now too right?|S|s|bu
me018|i don't know.|S|s|no
me034|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|it's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like like say thirty nine phone symbols.|S|s|bu
me018|so|F|fh|fh
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|uh and then they get the variety by by bringing in the context the phonetic context.|S|fh|fh
me013|uh so we actually have an unusually large number in in what we tend to use here.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|so actually maybe now you've got me sort of intrigued.|S|s|s
me013|what there's|D|%|%
me013|can you describe what what's on the cube?|Q|qy|co
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|i mean|D|%|%
me006|i i think that's a good idea.|S|s|na
me013|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|to to talk about the whole cube.|S|s|e
fn002|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on.|S|s|cs
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me006|uh do you want to do it?|Q|fg|fg
me013|so even even though the meeting recorder doesn't doesn't uh|D|s|s
me013|and since you're not running a video camera we won't get this.|S|s|s
me013|but if you use a board it'll help us anyway.|S|s|s
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|uh point out one of the limitations of this medium.|S|s|e
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|but you've got the wireless on.|S|s|bu
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|i have the wireless.|S|s|na
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so you can walk around.|S|s|s
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me006|can can you walk around too?|Q|qy|bu
me006|no.|S|s|ar
me006|okay.|F|fg|fg
me006|well.|F|fg|fg
me013|uh he can't actually.|S|s|nd
me006|um|F|fg|fg
me013|but|D|%|%
me013|he's tethered.|S|s|e
me006|basically the the cube will have three dimensions.|S|s|s
me006|the first dimension is the the features that we're going to use.|S|s|e
me006|and the second dimension um is the training corpus.|S|s|e
me006|and that's the training on the discriminant neural net.|S|s|e
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|and|F|fh|fh
me006|the last dimension happens to be|D|s|e
me013|yeah and again|D|fg|fg
me013|yeah so the the training for h t k is always that's always set up for the individual test.|S|s|bk
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|that there's some training data and some test data.|S|s|s
me013|so that's different than this.|S|s|bu
me006|right right.|S|s|aa
me006|this is this is for for a n n only.|S|s|e
me006|and yeah the training for the h t k models is always uh fixed for whatever language you're testing on.|S|s|e
me013|right.|S|s|bk
me006|and then there's the testing corpus.|S|s|s
me006|so then i think it's probably instructive to go and and and show you the features that we were talking about.|S|s|cs
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|so let's see.|S|s|s
me006|help me out with|D|s|co
mn007|p l p.|S|s|rt
me006|with what?|Q|qy|br
mn007|p l p.|S|s|rt
me006|p l p?|Q|qy|bu
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|m s g.|S|s|rt
me006|m s g.|S|s|m
mn007|uh j rasta.|S|fh|fh
me006|j rasta.|S|s|m
mn007|and j rasta l d a.|S|s|s
me006|j rasta l d a.|S|s|m
mn007|um|F|fh|fh
mn007|multi band.|S|s|s
me006|multi band.|S|s|m
mn007|so there would be multi band before um before our network i mean.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|just the multi band features right?|S|s|bu
mn007|and|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|so something like uh t c t within bands.|S|s|cs
me013|uh uh.|B|b|b
mn007|and well|F|fh|fh
mn007|and then multi band after networks meaning.|S|s|cs
mn007|that we would have uh neural networks uh discriminant neural networks for each band.|S|s|rt
mn007|uh yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|and using the the outputs of these networks or the linear outputs or something like that.|S|s|s
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me018|what about mel cepstrum?|Q|qw|qw
me006|oh um|D|s|bk
me018|or is that|D|qy|qy
me018|you don't include that because it's part of the base or something?|Q|qy|bu
me013|well you do have a baseline system that's that's mel cepstra.|S|s|bu
fn002|yeah databases.|S|s|aa
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so|F|fh|fh
fn002|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
mn007|but uh|F|h|h
mn007|well|F|fh|fh
mn007|not for the the a n n.|S|s|nd
mn007|i mean|D|%|%
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|so yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|we could we could add m f c c also.|S|s|cs
me006|we could add|D|s|cs
me013|probably should.|S|s|na
me013|i mean at least at least conceptually you know it doesn't meant you actually have to do it.|S|s|df
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|but|F|fh|fh
me013|conceptually it makes sense as a as a base line.|S|s|df
me018|it'd be an interesting test just to have just to do m f c c with the neural net.|S|s|cs
fn002|without the|D|s|2
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|and everything else the same.|S|s|e
me018|compare that with just m f c c without the the net.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
fn002|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|i think i think dan did some of that.|S|s|s
me018|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|um in his previous aurora experiments.|S|fh|fh
me006|and with the net it's it's wonderful.|S|s|s
me006|without the net it's just baseline.|S|s|s
me013|um i think o g i folks have been doing that too.|S|fg|fg
me013|because i think that for a bunch of their experiments they used uh mel cepstra actually.|S|s|e
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|um of course that's there and this is here and so on.|S|fh|fh
me013|okay.|S|s|rt
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me006|um for the training corpus corpus um we have um the the digits from the various languages.|S|fh|fh
me006|um english.|S|fh|fh
me006|spanish.|S|s|e
me006|um french .|S|fh|fh
me006|what else do we have?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|and the finnish.|S|s|s
me006|finnish.|S|s|m
fn002|and italian.|S|s|s
me018|where did where did that come from?|Q|qw|rt
fn002|uh no italian no.|S|s|ar
me018|digits?|Q|qy|bu
fn002|italian no.|S|s|ar
me018|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|oh italian.|S|s|m
fn002|italian yes.|S|s|aa
fn002|italian.|S|s|s
me013|italian.|D|s|s
me018|is that was that distributed with aurora?|Q|qy|rt
me018|or|D|qrr|qrr
me006|one l or two l s?|Q|qr|bu
me013|the newer one.|S|s|t3
me018|where did that|D|qw|qw
mn007|so english uh finnish and italian are aurora.|S|s|na
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|and spanish and french is something that we can use in addition to aurora.|S|s|e
mn007|uh well|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so carmen brought the spanish.|S|s|s
me013|and stephane brought the french.|S|s|s
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me006|and|F|fh|fh
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|is it french french or belgian french?|Q|qr|qr
me006|and|D|fh|fh
me013|there's a|D|%|%
mn007|it's uh french french.|S|s|s
me006|french french.|S|s|s
fn002|like mexican spain and spain.|S|s|j
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me034|or swiss.|S|s|s
fn002|i think that is more important.|S|s|s
me034|swiss german.|S|s|e
fn002|mexican spain.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
fn002|because more people|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|probably so.|S|s|am
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah herve always insists that belgian is is absolutely pure french.|S|s|s
me013|has nothing to do with|D|s|s
me013|but he says those those those parisians talk funny.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah yeah yeah.|D|b|b
mn007|they have an accent.|S|s|na
me013|yeah they|D|s|aa
me013|they do yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah but then he likes belgian fries too.|S|s|j
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
me006|and then we have uh um broader broader corpus um like timit.|S|s|tc
me006|timit so far.|S|s|bu
fn002|and spanish too.|S|s|rt
me006|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|spanish.|S|s|m
me006|oh spanish stories?|S|s|bk
fn002|albayzin is the name.|S|s|s
me018|what about t i digits?|Q|qw|qw
me006|um t i digits|D|h|h
me006|uh all these aurora data data is from is derived from t i digits.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|oh oh okay.|S|s|bk
me006|um basically they they corrupted it with uh different kinds of noises at different s n r levels.|S|fh|fh
me018|uh.|B|b|b
me018|i see.|S|s|bk
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and i think stephane was saying there's there's some broader material in the french also.|S|s|bu
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|we we could use|D|s|s
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|the french data.|S|s|s
fn002|spanish stories?|Q|qy|bu
fn002|no.|S|s|ar
me006|no.|S|s|ar
me006|not spanish stories.|S|s|nd
fn002|no.|S|s|ar
me013|spanish.|S|s|s
fn002|no|D|s|s
me006|spanish something.|S|s|s
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me034|did the aurora people actually corrupt it themselves?|Q|qy|qy
me034|or just specify the signal and the signal-t0-noise ratio?|Q|qrr|qrr
me006|they they corrupted it um themselves.|S|s|na
me034|okay.|B|b|b
me006|but they also included the the noise files for us.|S|s|bu
me006|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|or|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|so we can go ahead and corrupt other things.|S|s|cs
me013|i'm just curious carmen.|S|s|s
me013|i mean i couldn't tell if you were joking or|D|s|s
me013|is it is it mexican spanish?|Q|qy|bu
me013|or is it|D|qrr|qrr
fn002|no no no no.|S|s|ar
me013|oh no no.|S|s|bk
fn002|no no no no.|S|s|ar
me013|it's it's spanish from spain spanish.|S|s|s
fn002|spanish from spain.|S|s|s
me013|yeah okay.|S|s|bk
me006|from spain.|S|s|m
me013|all right.|B|b|b
me013|spanish from spain.|S|s|bk
me013|we're really covered there.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|F|fh|fh
me013|and the french from france.|S|s|s
me006|okay.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah.|F|fg|fg
mn007|no the french is yeah from uh paris.|S|s|ar
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|from paris.|S|s|bk
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|okay.|B|b|b
me006|and timit's from lots of different places.|S|s|s
me013|from t i.|S|s|2
me013|it's from texas.|S|s|s
me013|so maybe it's|D|s|s
me034|from the deep south.|S|s|j
me013|so it's not really from the u s either.|S|s|j
me013|is that okay?|Q|qy|qy
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|okay.|F|fg|fg
me006|and um|F|fg|fg
me006|within the training corporas um we're uh thinking about um training with noise.|S|s|s
me006|so|F|fh|fh
me006|incorporating the same kinds of noises that um aurora is incorporating in their um in their training corpus.|S|s|s
me006|um i don't think we're given the uh the unseen noise conditions though.|S|fh|fh
me006|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|i think what they were saying was that um for this next test there's going to be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you're not.|S|s|arp
me006|like|D|%|%
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn007|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so presumably that'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results is how well you do when it's matching noise and how well you do where it's not.|S|s|s
me006|right.|S|s|bk
me013|i think that's right.|S|s|s
me006|so i guess we can't train on on the the unseen noise conditions.|S|s|bu
me013|well not if it's not seen.|S|s|na
me006|right.|B|b|b
me006|if not if it's unseen.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|i mean it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that's at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of noise.|S|s|s
me013|even if it's not matching.|S|s|e
me013|just because there's some more variance that you've built into things.|S|s|df
me013|but but uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|uh exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time.|S|s|s
me013|so okay so that's your training corpus.|S|s|s
mn007|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|and then your testing corpus?|Q|qy|bu
me006|um the testing corporas are um just um the same ones as aurora testing.|S|h|h
me006|and that includes um the english um italian finnish.|S|fh|fh
fn002|finnish.|S|s|2
me006|uh we're going to get german.|S|fh|fh
me006|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|at the final test will have german.|S|s|na
me013|well so|F|h|h
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|the final test on a guess is supposed to be german and danish.|S|s|bu
mn007|uh yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|right.|S|s|aa
mn007|the|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|F|fg|fg
mn007|the spanish perhaps.|S|s|cs
me006|spanish.|S|s|bk
mn007|we will have|D|%|%
me006|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|we can we can test on spanish.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|but the the aurora spanish i mean.|S|s|cs
me006|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me013|oh there's a there's spanish testing in the aurora?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|uh not yet.|S|s|nd
mn007|but uh uh|F|fh|fh
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|it's preparing.|S|s|s
mn007|they are preparing it.|S|s|m
mn007|and well|F|fh|fh
fn002|they are preparing.|S|s|s
mn007|according to hynek it will be we will have this at the end of november.|S|s|s
mn007|or um|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
me013|so uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|something like seven things in each uh each column.|S|s|co
me013|so that's uh three hundred and forty three uh different systems that are going to be developed.|S|s|s
me013|there's three of you.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so that's|D|s|s
me006|yeah one hundred each about.|S|s|s
me013|hundred and hundred and fourteen each.|S|s|s
me026|what what about noise conditions?|Q|qw|rt
me013|what?|Q|qw|br
me026|don't we need to put in the column for noise conditions?|Q|qy|rt
me013|are you just trying to be difficult?|Q|qh|j
me026|no.|S|s|ar
me026|i just don't understand.|S|s|df
me006|well|D|%|%
me006|uh|F|fg|fg
me013|i'm just kidding.|S|s|t3
me006|when when i put these testings on there i'm|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|there's three three tests.|S|s|s
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|type a type b and type c.|S|s|e
me006|and they're all they're all going to be tested um with one training of the h t k system.|S|s|s
me006|um there's a script that tests all three different types of noise conditions.|S|s|s
me006|test a is like a matched noise.|S|s|e
me006|test b is a is a slightly mismatched.|S|s|e
me006|and test c is a um mismatched channel.|S|s|e
me026|and do we do all our training on clean data?|Q|qy|rt
me006|um|F|h|h
fn002|also we can clean that|D|s|s
me006|no no.|S|s|ar
mn007|no.|S|s|ar
me006|we're we're going to be um training on the noise files that we do have.|S|s|df
me013|so|F|fg|fg
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so i guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training?|Q|qw|qw
me013|i mean it's not totally crazy.|S|s|df
me013|i mean these are a lot of these are built in things.|S|s|s
me013|and we know we have programs that compute p l p.|S|s|e
me013|we have m s g.|S|s|e
me013|we have j|D|s|e
me013|you know a lot of these things will just kind of happen.|S|s|s
me013|won't take uh a huge amount of development.|S|s|s
me013|it's just trying it out.|S|s|s
me013|so we actually can do quite a few experiments.|S|s|s
me013|but how how long does it take do we think for one of these trainings?|Q|qw|qw
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|that's a good question.|S|s|ba
me018|what about combinations of things?|Q|qw|cs
me013|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|that's right.|S|s|bk
me013|i mean because|D|s|s
me013|so for instance i think the major advantage of m s g|D|s|s
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|och!|S|s|fe
me013|good point.|S|s|ba
me013|major advantage of m s g i see that we've seen in the past is combined with p l p.|S|s|s
fn002|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me006|now this is turning into a four dimensional cube?|Q|qy|bu
me034|or you just add it to the features.|S|s|cs
fn002|no.|S|s|ar
me018|well you just select multiple things on the one dimension.|S|s|nd
fn002|here.|D|s|s
me006|just|D|%|%
me006|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|so i mean|F|fg|fg
me013|you don't want to|D|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|let's see.|S|s|t1
me013|seven choose two would be uh twenty one different combinations.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me034|it's not a complete set of combinations though.|S|s|bu
me013|probably|D|%|%
me034|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|what?|Q|qw|br
me034|it's not a complete set of combinations though.|S|s|bu
me006|no.|S|s|ar
me034|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|i hope not.|S|s|nd
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|there's|D|%|%
me006|that would be|D|qy|d
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so p l p and m s g i think we definitely want to try.|S|s|co
me013|because we've had a lot of good experience with putting those together.|S|s|df
fn002|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me018|when you do that you're increasing the size of the inputs to the net.|S|s|rt
me018|do you have to reduce the hidden layer or something?|Q|qy|qy
me013|well so|F|fg|fg
me013|i mean|F|fh|fh
me013|so it doesn't increase the number of trainings.|S|s|s
me018|no no.|S|s|ar
me018|i'm i'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net.|S|s|bu
me018|do you have to worry about keeping that the same?|Q|qy|bu
me018|or|D|qrr|qrr
me013|uh i don't think so.|S|h|h
me034|there's a computation limit though.|S|s|bu
me034|isn't there?|Q|qy|g
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|i mean it's just more|D|s|s
me013|excuse me?|Q|qw|br
me034|isn't there like a limit on the computation load or latency or something like that for aurora task?|Q|qy|bu
me013|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|we haven't talked about any of that at all.|S|s|bu
me013|have we?|Q|qy|g
me006|no.|S|s|ar
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|so there's not really a limit.|S|s|nd
me013|what it is is that there's there's uh it's just penalty.|S|s|e
me013|you know?|Q|qy|d
me013|that that if you're using uh a megabyte then they'll say that's very nice.|S|s|e
me013|but of course it will never go on a cheap cell phone.|S|s|e
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me034|okay.|B|b|b
me013|and|F|fh|fh
me013|uh i think the computation isn't so much of a problem.|S|s|s
me013|i think it's more the memory.|S|s|s
me013|uh and expensive cell phones expensive hand helds and so forth are going to have lots of memory.|S|s|e
me013|so it's just that uh these people see the the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market.|S|s|e
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me034|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|but yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|i was just realizing that actually it doesn't explode out.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|it's not really two to the seventh.|S|s|s
me013|but it's but but it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings.|S|s|s
me013|because these were all trained individually.|S|s|df
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|uh if you have all of these nets trained some place then uh you can combine their outputs and do the k l transformation and so forth.|S|s|cs
me013|and and uh|F|fh|fh
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|so what it it blows out is the number of uh testings.|S|s|s
me013|and you know and the number of times you do that last part.|S|s|s
me013|but that last part i think is so has got to be pretty quick.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|right.|F|fh|fh
me013|i mean it's just running the data through.|S|s|s
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me013|well you got to do the k l transformation.|S|s|s
me018|but what about a net that's trained on multiple languages though?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|eight|D|%|%
me013|but|D|%|%
me018|is that just separate nets for each language then combined?|Q|qy|bu
fn002|necessary to put in.|S|s|s
me018|or is that actually one net trained on?|Q|qrr|qrr
mn007|uh probably one net.|S|s|na
me013|good question.|S|s|ba
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|one would think one net.|S|s|na
mn007|so|F|fh|fh
me013|but we've i don't think we've tested that.|S|s|bu
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
mn007|so in the broader training corpus we can we can use uh the three or a combination of of two two languages.|S|s|cs
fn002|database three.|S|s|s
me018|in one net.|S|s|2
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|so i guess the first thing is if if we know how much a how long a a training takes.|S|s|s
me013|if we can train up all these these combinations uh then we can start working on testing of them individually and in combination.|S|s|cs
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|because the putting them in combination i think is not as much computationally as the training of the nets in the first place.|S|s|df
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|right?|D|qy|d
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|so you do have to compute the k l transformation.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|which is a little bit.|S|s|e
me013|but it's not too much.|S|s|e
mn007|it's not too much.|S|s|m
mn007|no.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so it's|D|s|s
mn007|but yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|but there is the testing also which implies training uh the h t k models.|S|s|s
fn002|the the model.|S|s|2
mn007|and well|F|fh|fh
fn002|the h t k model.|S|s|2
me013|uh right.|S|s|aa
mn007|it's|D|%|%
me013|right.|S|s|aa
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so if you do have lots of combinations it's|D|s|s
mn007|but it's it's it's not so long.|S|s|s
mn007|it|D|%|%
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|how long does it take for an uh h t k training?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|it's around six hours i think.|S|s|s
fn002|it depends on the|D|s|s
mn007|for training and testing.|S|s|e
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
fn002|more than six hours.|S|s|nd
mn007|more.|S|s|bk
fn002|for the italian.|S|s|e
fn002|yes.|S|s|aa
fn002|maybe one day.|S|s|s
mn007|one day.|S|s|bk
me013|for h t k?|Q|qy|bu
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|really?|Q|qh|bk
fn002|well.|B|b|b
me013|running on what?|Q|qw|d
fn002|uh m f c c.|S|s|rt
me013|no.|S|s|ar
me013|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
me013|running on what machine?|Q|qw|d
fn002|uh ravioli.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|h|h
me013|i don't know what ravioli is.|S|s|no
me013|is it is it an ultra five?|Q|qy|rt
me013|or is it a|D|qrr|qrr
fn002|huh.|B|b|b
fn002|um who is that?|Q|qw|qw
me018|i don't know.|S|s|no
me006|i don't know.|S|s|no
fn002|i don't know.|S|s|no
me034|i don't know what a ravioli is.|S|s|no
fn002|i don't know.|S|s|no
me006|i don't know.|S|s|no
me034|we can check really quickly.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me034|i guess.|S|s|s
mn007|i think it's not so long.|S|s|s
mn007|because well the t i digits test data is about uh many hours.|S|s|s
mn007|uh uh thirty hours of speech i think.|S|s|e
me013|it's a few hours.|S|s|2
mn007|something like that.|S|s|s
me034|huh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah right.|F|fg|fg
mn007|and it|D|%|%
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
me013|so|F|fg|fg
me013|i mean|F|fg|fg
me013|clearly there's no way we can even begin to do any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines.|S|s|cs
mn007|it's six hours.|S|s|s
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so we|D|s|s
me013|i mean there's plenty of machines here.|S|s|df
me013|and they're they're often not in in a great great deal of use.|S|s|df
me013|so i mean i think it's it's key that that the that you look at uh you know what machines are fast what machines are used a lot.|S|s|co
me013|uh are we still using p make?|Q|qy|bu
me013|is that|D|qy|qy
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|i don't know how how we would p make this though.|S|s|ng
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me013|well you have a|D|s|s
me013|i mean once you get the basic thing set up you have just all the uh all these combinations.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|it's let's say it's six hours or eight hours or something for the training of h t k.|S|s|s
me013|how long is it for training of of uh the neural net?|Q|qw|qw
me006|the neural net?|Q|qy|bk
me006|um|F|fh|fh
mn007|i would say two days.|S|s|s
me018|depends on the corpuses right?|S|s|arp
fn002|it depends.|S|s|arp
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me034|it also depends on the net.|S|s|na
fn002|depends on the corpus.|S|s|arp
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me034|how big is the net?|Q|qw|rt
fn002|for albayzin i trained on neural network.|S|s|s
fn002|uh was um one day also.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fg|fg
me013|but on what machine?|Q|qw|d
me006|on a spert board.|S|s|s
fn002|uh|F|h|h
fn002|i i think the neural net spert.|S|s|s
me006|you did a you did it on a spert board.|S|s|r
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
fn002|yes.|S|s|aa
me013|again we do have a bunch of spert boards.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|and i think there's i think you folks are probably the ones using them right now.|S|s|s
me018|is it faster to do it on the spert?|Q|qy|rt
me018|or|D|qrr|qrr
me013|uh don't know.|S|h|h
me013|used to be.|S|s|aap
me006|it's it's still a little faster on the sperts.|S|s|na
me018|is it?|Q|qh|bk
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|adam adam did some testing.|S|s|e
me006|or either adam or or dan did some testing.|S|s|e
me006|and they found that the spert board's still still faster.|S|s|e
me006|and the benefits is that you know you run out of spert and then you can do other things on your your computer.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|and you don't|D|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so you could be|D|s|s
me013|we have quite a few spert boards.|S|s|s
me013|you could set up uh you know ten different jobs or something to run on spert different spert boards.|S|s|cs
me013|and and have ten other jobs running on different computers.|S|s|s
me013|so it's got to take that sort of thing.|S|s|s
me013|or or we're not going to get through any significant number of these.|S|s|s
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so this is|D|s|s
me013|yeah i mean|F|fg|fg
me013|i kind of like this because what it|D|s|s
me013|no.|S|s|ar
me013|what i like about it is|D|s|s
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|we we we do have a problem.|S|s|s
me013|that we have very limited time.|S|s|e
me013|you know.|F|fh|fh
me013|so with very limited time we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available.|S|s|s
me013|if you you know get a look across the institute and how little things are being used.|S|s|df
me013|and uh|F|fh|fh
me013|on the other hand almost anything that really you know is is new where we're saying well let's look at like we were talking before about uh uh voiced-unvoiced-silence detection features and all those sort that's|D|s|s
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|i think it's a great thing to go to.|S|s|s
me013|but if it's new then we have this development and and and learning process to to go through on top of just the the all the all the work.|S|s|s
me013|so i i i don't see how we'd do it.|S|s|nd
me013|so what i like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do.|S|s|s
me013|and and all the kinds of data that we at this point already have.|S|s|s
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and uh you're just saying let's look at the outer product of all of these things.|S|fh|fh
me013|and see if we can calculate them.|S|s|s
me013|am i am i interpreting this correctly?|Q|qy|bu
me013|is this sort of what what you're thinking of doing in the short term?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|so so then i think it's just the the missing piece is that you need to uh you know you know talk to talk to uh chuck talk to uh adam.|S|s|co
me013|uh sort out about uh what's the best way to really you know attack this as a as a as a mass problem in terms of using many machines.|S|s|co
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|and uh then you know set it up in terms of scripts and so forth and uh in in kind some kind of structured way.|S|s|co
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|um and you know when we go to uh o g i next week uh we can then present to them you know what it is that we're doing.|S|s|co
me013|and uh we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently.|S|fh|fh
me006|huh.|B|b|b
me013|that you know we're not we won't be contributing that much.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|and uh|F|fh|fh
me013|then uh like we're there.|S|s|s
me034|how big are the nets you're using?|Q|qw|rt
me006|um for the for nets trained on digits um we have been using uh four hundred order hidden units.|S|h|h
me006|and um for the broader class nets we're we're going to increase that.|S|fh|fh
me006|because the um the digits nets only correspond to about twenty phonemes.|S|s|df
me034|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|so|F|fh|fh
me013|broader class?|Q|qw|bu
me006|um the broader broader training corpus nets.|S|h|h
me006|like timit.|S|s|e
me006|um we're going to|D|fh|fh
me013|oh.|S|s|bk
me013|it's not actually broader class.|S|s|ng
me013|it's actually finer class.|S|s|ng
me013|but you mean you mean more classes.|S|s|s
me006|right.|S|s|aa
me006|right.|B|b|b
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|more classes.|S|s|bk
me006|right right.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|more classes.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|that's what i mean.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|and|F|fh|fh
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|carmen did you do you have something else to add?|Q|qy|rt
me013|we you haven't talked too much.|S|s|df
me013|and|F|fh|fh
fn002|i begin to work with the italian database to nnn to with the front end and with the h t k program and the.|S|s|s
fn002|and i trained uh with the spanish two neural network with p l p and with lograsta p l p.|S|s|s
fn002|i don't know exactly what is better if if lograsta or j rasta.|S|s|no
me013|well um j rasta has the potential to do better.|S|h|h
me013|but it doesn't always.|S|s|s
me013|it's j rasta is more complicated.|S|s|e
me013|it's it's uh instead of doing rasta with a log you're doing rasta with a log like function that varies depending on a j parameter.|S|s|df
me013|uh which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is.|S|s|e
me013|so it's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in is dependent on how much noise there is.|S|s|df
fn002|huh huh.|B|b|b
me013|and so in j rasta you attempt to do that.|S|s|s
me013|it's a little complicated.|S|s|s
me013|because once you do that you end up in some funny domain.|S|s|df
me013|and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards.|S|s|df
me013|which requires some tables.|S|s|e
me013|and uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so it's it's it's a little messier.|S|s|s
fn002|huh huh.|B|b|b
me013|uh there's more ways that it can go wrong.|S|s|s
me013|uh but if if if you're careful with it it can do better.|S|fh|fh
fn002|it's a bit i'll do better.|S|s|m
me013|so it's|D|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
fn002|um and i think to to to recognize the italian digits with the neural spanish neural network.|S|fg|fg
fn002|and also to train another neural network with the spanish digits.|S|s|cs
fn002|the database of spanish digits.|S|s|bsc
fn002|and i working that.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
fn002|but to prepare the the database are difficult.|S|s|s
fn002|was for me it was a difficult work last week with the labels.|S|s|s
fn002|because the the program with the label obtained that i have the albayzin is different to the label to train the neural network.|S|s|df
fn002|and that is another work that we must to do to to change.|S|s|cs
me013|i didn't understand.|S|s|br
fn002|uh for example albayzin database was labeled automatically with h t k.|S|s|s
fn002|it's not hand.|S|s|df
fn002|it's not labels by hand.|S|s|df
me013|oh.|S|s|bk
me013|labeled.|S|s|bk
me013|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fn002|labels.|S|s|bk
me013|i have a i had a problem with the pronunciation.|S|s|df
fn002|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fn002|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fn002|the labels.|S|s|bk
fn002|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fn002|the labels.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so|F|fg|fg
me013|okay.|F|fg|fg
fn002|oh also that|D|%|%
me013|so let's start over.|S|s|co
me013|so timit's hand labeled.|S|s|bs
fn002|yes.|S|s|aa
me013|and and you're saying about the spanish?|Q|qw|br
fn002|the spanish labels.|S|s|s
fn002|that was in different format.|S|s|s
me013|oh i see.|S|s|bk
fn002|that the format for the them the program to train the neural network.|S|s|e
fn002|i necessary to convert.|S|s|s
fn002|and|D|%|%
fn002|well|F|fh|fh
me018|so you're just having a problem converting the labels.|S|s|bs
fn002|it's it's|D|%|%
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|but|D|%|%
fn002|yes.|S|s|aa
fn002|because they have one program feacalc.|S|s|df
fn002|but no.|S|s|ar
fn002|labecut but don't doesn't uh include the h t k format to convert.|S|s|df
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fn002|and|F|fh|fh
me034|huh.|B|b|b
fn002|i don't know what.|S|s|no
fn002|i ask even i ask to dan ellis what i can do that.|S|s|s
fn002|and they he say me that he doesn't any any any form to to do that.|S|s|s
fn002|and at the end i think that with labecut i can transfer to ascii format.|S|s|cc
fn002|and h t k is an ascii format.|S|s|e
fn002|and i do another uh one program to put ascii format of h t k to ascii format to exceed.|S|s|cc
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fn002|and they used labcut to to pass.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
fn002|actually that was complicated.|S|s|s
me013|so you|D|%|%
fn002|but well i know how we can did that do that.|S|s|s
me013|sure.|S|s|bk
me013|so it's just usual kind of uh sometimes say housekeeping.|S|s|bu
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|to get these get these things sorted out.|S|s|e
fn002|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so it seems like there's there's some peculiarities of the uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out.|S|s|s
me013|and then um if if you work on getting the uh assembly lines together and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line.|S|s|s
me013|and gradually can start you know start turning the crank more or less.|S|s|s
me013|and uh uh|F|fh|fh
me013|we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at o g i.|S|s|s
me013|so i think that if|D|s|s
me013|what's what's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way.|S|s|ba
me013|so that uh once these all of these you know mundane but real problems get sorted out we can just start turning the crank.|S|s|cs
fn002|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|and and push all of us through.|S|s|cs
me013|and then finally figure out what's best.|S|s|cs
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|um|F|fg|fg
me006|i i was thinking two things.|S|s|s
me006|uh the first thing was um|D|fh|fh
me006|we we actually had thought of this as sort of like um not not in stages but more along the the time axis.|S|s|s
me006|just kind of like one stream at a time.|S|s|e
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|je-je-je-je-je check out the results.|S|s|e
me006|and and go that way.|S|s|e
me013|oh yeah yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|sure.|S|s|bk
me013|no i'm just saying i'm just thinking of it like loops.|S|fg|fg
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|and so if you had three nested loops that you have a choice for this a choice for this and a choice for that.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|and you're going through them all.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|that that's what i meant.|S|s|s
me006|right.|S|s|aa
me006|right.|S|s|aa
me013|and uh the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do uh um concurrently on different machines different sperts and so forth uh and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth you can stand back from it and say okay if we look at all these combinations we're talking about and combinations of combinations and so forth you'll probably find you can't do it all.|S|fh|fh
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so then at that point uh we should sort out which ones do we throw away.|S|s|co
me013|which of the combinations across you know what are the most likely ones.|S|s|e
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|and|D|%|%
me013|and uh|F|fh|fh
me013|i still think we could do a lot of them.|S|s|s
me013|i mean it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something.|S|s|e
me013|but probably when you include all the combinations you're actually talking about a thousand of them or something.|S|s|s
me013|and that's probably more than we can do.|S|s|df
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|but a hundred is a lot.|S|s|bd
me013|and and uh um|F|fh|fh
me006|okay.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|and the the second thing was about scratch space.|S|s|rt
me006|and i think you sent an email about um scratch space for for people to work on.|S|s|s
me006|and i know that uh stephane's working from an n t machine.|S|s|s
me006|so his his home directory exists somewhere else.|S|s|s
me013|his his stuff is somewhere else.|S|s|2
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|i mean my point|D|s|s
me013|i i want to|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|thanks for bring it back to that.|S|s|ft
me013|my i want to clarify my point about that that that chuck repeated in his note.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|we're over the next year or two we're going to be upgrading the networks in this place.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|but right now they're still all pretty much all ten megabit lines.|S|s|s
me013|and we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster.|S|s|s
me013|so it actually has reached the point where it's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|so you you don't especially in something with repetitive computation where you're going over it multiple times you do don't want to have the the data that you're working on distant from where it's being where the computation's being done if you can help it.|S|s|cs
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|now we are getting more disk for the central file server.|S|s|s
me013|which since it's not a computational server would seem to be a contradiction to what i just said.|S|s|e
me013|but the idea is that uh suppose you're working with uh this big bunch of multi multi lingual databases.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|you put them all in the central at the central file server.|S|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|then when you're working with something and accessing it many times you copy the piece of it that you're working with over to some place that's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there.|S|s|s
me013|and then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others.|S|s|df
me006|huh.|B|b|b
me013|that's the idea.|S|s|s
me013|so uh it's going to take us|D|fh|fh
me013|it may be too late for this uh precise crunch we're in now.|S|s|s
me013|but uh|F|fh|fh
me013|we're|D|%|%
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|it's going to take us a couple weeks at least to get the uh uh the amount of disk we're going to be getting we're actually going to get.|S|s|s
me013|uh i think four more uh thirty six gigabyte drives.|S|s|e
me013|and uh put them on another another disk rack|D|s|s
me013|we ran out of space on the disk rack that we had.|S|s|s
me013|so we're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between uh primarily between this project and the meetings meetings project.|S|s|s
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|but uh|F|fh|fh
me013|we've put another i guess there's another eighteen gigabytes that's that's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch.|S|s|s
me013|but uh|F|fh|fh
me013|are you saying|D|qy|qy
me013|so i don't know where you're|D|s|no
me013|stephane where you're doing your computations?|Q|qw|qw
me013|if so you're on n t machine.|S|s|s
me013|so you're using some external machine too.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|it|D|%|%
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|well|F|fh|fh
mn007|to|D|%|%
mn007|it's nutmeg and mustard i think.|S|s|na
mn007|it uh|D|%|%
me013|do you know these yet?|Q|qy|qy
mn007|i don't know what kind.|S|s|no
me018|nuh uh.|S|s|ar
me013|yeah okay.|S|s|bk
me013|uh|F|fg|fg
me013|are these are these uh computational servers or something?|Q|qy|qy
me013|i'm i've been kind of out of it.|S|s|df
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|i think yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|i think so.|S|s|na
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|unfortunately these days my idea of running of doing computation is running a spread sheet.|S|s|j
me013|so|F|fh|fh
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally.|S|s|df
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so those are computational servers.|S|s|s
me013|so i guess the other question is what disk there space there is there on the computational servers.|S|s|s
me018|right.|B|b|b
me018|yeah i'm not sure what's available on|D|s|bk
me018|is it|D|qy|qy
me018|you said nutmeg.|S|s|bs
me018|and what was the other one?|Q|qw|bu
mn007|mustard.|S|s|rt
me018|mustard.|S|s|bk
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me034|huh.|B|b|b
me013|well you're the you're the disk czar now.|S|s|j
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me018|right right.|S|s|bk
me018|well i'll check on that.|S|s|cc
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah so basically uh chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where and so on.|S|s|bk
me013|and i'll be the one who says okay spend the money.|S|s|s
me013|which i mean|D|s|e
me013|these days uh if you're talking about scratch space it doesn't increase the uh need for backup.|S|s|s
me013|and uh i think it's not that big a|D|fh|fh
me013|and the the disks themselves are not that expensive.|S|s|df
me013|right now it's|D|s|e
me018|what you can do when you're on that machine is uh just go to the slash scratch directory and do a d f minus k.|S|s|cs
me018|and it'll tell you if there's space available.|S|s|s
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|uh and if there is then uh|D|s|s
me013|but wasn't it uh|D|qy|bu
me013|i think dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash scratch.|S|s|ng
me013|it's more putting in x a or x b or|D|s|bu
me018|well there's different there um there's|D|s|s
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me018|right.|S|s|aa
me018|so there's the slash x whatever disks and then there's slash scratch.|S|s|s
me018|and both of those two kinds are not backed up.|S|s|e
me018|and if it's called slash scratch it means it's probably an internal disk to the machine.|S|s|e
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|and so that's the kind of thing where like if um okay if you don't have an n t but you have a a a unix workstation and they attach an external disk it'll be called slash x something uh if it's not backed up.|S|s|e
me018|and it'll be slash d something if it is backed up.|S|s|e
me018|and if it's inside the machine on the desk it's called slash scratch.|S|s|e
me018|but the problem is if you ever get a new machine they take your machine away.|S|s|s
me018|it's easy to unhook the external disks.|S|s|s
me018|put them back on the new machine.|S|s|s
me018|but then your slash scratch is gone.|S|s|s
me018|so you don't want to put anything in slash scratch that you want to keep around for a long period of time.|S|s|s
me018|but if it's a copy of say some data that's on a server you can put it on slash scratch.|S|s|s
me018|because um first of all it's not backed up.|S|s|df
me018|and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine.|S|s|df
me018|because you just recopy it to slash scratch.|S|s|df
me018|so that's why i was saying you could check slash scratch on those on on um mustard and and nutmeg to see if if there's space that you could use there.|S|s|df
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
me018|you could also use slash x whatever disks on mustard and nutmeg.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|and we do have|D|s|s
me018|i mean|D|%|%
me018|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|so so you|D|%|%
me018|yeah it's better to have things local if you're going to run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network.|S|s|cs
me013|right.|S|s|aa
me013|so so especially if you're right if you're if you're taking some piece of the training corpus which usually resides in where chuck is putting it all on the on the uh file server uh then yeah it's fine if it's not backed up.|S|s|s
me013|because if it gets wiped out or something i mean it is backed up on the other disk.|S|s|df
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|B|b|b
me018|yeah so one of the things that i need to i've started looking at|D|fg|fg
me018|uh is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff?|Q|qy|rt
me013|sure.|S|s|aa
me018|i've started looking at um disk space.|S|s|s
me018|dan david um put a new um drive onto abbott that's an x disk.|S|s|s
me018|which means it's not backed up.|S|s|e
me018|so|F|fh|fh
me018|um i've been going through and copying data that is you know some kind of corpus stuff usually that that we've got on a c d rom or something onto that new disk to free up space on other disks.|S|fh|fh
me018|and um so far um i've copied a couple of carmen's um databases over there.|S|s|s
me018|we haven't deleted them off of the slash d c disk that they're on right now in abbott.|S|s|s
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|uh but we i would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto um this new disk also.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah okay.|S|s|aa
me018|there's there's a lot more space there.|S|s|df
me018|and it'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things.|S|s|df
me018|so anything that that you don't need backed up we can put on this new disk.|S|s|s
me018|um but if it's experiments and you're creating files and things that you're going to need you probably want to have those on a disk that's backed up just in case something goes wrong.|S|s|cs
me018|so|F|fh|fh
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|so far i've i've copied a couple of things.|S|s|s
me018|but i haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet.|S|s|s
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|and i haven't looked at the any of the aurora stuff.|S|s|s
me018|except for the spanish.|S|s|e
me018|so i i guess i'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah okay.|S|s|aa
me013|um|F|fg|fg
me013|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me013|i i just|D|s|s
me013|another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|um|F|h|h
mn007|well we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments.|S|s|s
mn007|um|F|fh|fh
me013|this being?|Q|qw|bu
mn007|so|F|fh|fh
mn007|but|D|%|%
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|so that this could be another dimension.|S|s|s
mn007|but we think perhaps we can use the the best uh um uh normalization scheme as o g i is using.|S|s|rt
mn007|so with parameters that they use there.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|i think that's a good idea.|S|s|ba
me013|i mean it's we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is.|S|s|df
me013|so probably if we sort of take their|D|s|s
mn007|yeah yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me013|probably the online line normalization.|S|s|s
me013|because then it it's if we do anything else we're going to end up having to do online normalization too.|S|s|df
me013|so we may as well just do online normalization.|S|s|cs
mn007|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|so that it's plausible for the final thing.|S|s|s
me013|good.|S|s|ba
me013|um|F|fg|fg
me013|so i guess|D|%|%
me013|yeah the other topic|D|s|s
me013|i maybe we're already there or almost there is goals for the for next week's meeting.|S|s|s
me013|uh it seems to me that we want to do is flush out what you put on the board here.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|you know maybe have it be somewhat visual little bit.|S|s|cs
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me006|like a like a slide?|Q|qy|bu
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so we can say what we're doing.|S|s|df
me013|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|and um also if you have sorted out um this information about how long roughly how long it takes to do on what and you know what we can how many of these trainings uh uh and testings and so forth that we can realistically do uh then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to to actually settle on which of them we're going to do.|S|s|cs
me013|and uh when we come back we can charge in and do it.|S|fh|fh
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|anything else that|D|qo|qo
me013|actually started out this this field trip started off with with uh stephane talking to hynek.|S|s|s
me013|so you may have you may have had other goals uh for going up.|S|s|s
me013|and anything else you can think of would be we should think about accomplishing?|Q|qo|d
me013|i mean i'm just saying this because maybe there's things we need to do in preparation.|S|s|df
mn007|oh i think basically this is this is|D|s|s
mn007|uh yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|okay.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|B|b|b
me013|uh|F|fg|fg
me013|all right.|F|fg|fg
me013|and uh and the other the the last topic i had here was um uh dave's fine offer to to uh do something on this.|S|s|t
me013|i mean he's doing he's working on other things.|S|s|df
me013|but to to do something on this project.|S|s|e
me013|so the question is where where could we uh uh most use dave's help?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|um|F|h|h
mn007|yeah.|F|h|h
mn007|i was thinking perhaps if um additionally to all these experiments which is not really research.|S|s|s
mn007|well i mean it's uh running programs.|S|s|df
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|and um trying to have a closer look at the perhaps the um speech uh noise detection or uh voiced-sound-unvoiced-sound detection.|S|s|cs
mn007|and which could be important in for noise noise.|S|s|df
me018|i think that would be a i think that's a big big deal.|S|s|s
me018|because the you know the thing that sunil was talking about uh with the labels uh labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff.|S|s|df
me018|the that that really throws things off.|S|s|df
me018|you know having the noise all of a sudden your your um speech detector.|S|s|s
me018|i mean the the um|D|s|bsc
me018|what was it?|Q|qw|qw
me013|um.|B|b|b
me018|what was happening with his thing?|Q|qw|rt
me018|he was running through these models very quickly.|S|s|s
me018|he was getting lots of uh uh insertions is what it was.|S|s|s
me018|in his recognitions.|S|s|e
me013|the only problem|D|s|nd
me013|i mean maybe that's the right thing.|S|s|am
me013|the only problem i have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it'd be a good thing to do.|S|s|nd
me013|um i i think that|D|fh|fh
me013|let's fall back to that.|S|s|co
me013|but i think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there's something that uh an an additional|D|s|co
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|that's a good thing you remove the mike.|S|s|ba
me013|go ahead.|S|s|co
me013|good.|S|s|ba
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|what an additional clever person could help with when we're really in a crunch for time.|S|s|s
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|because dave's going to be around for a long time.|S|s|df
me013|all right?|Q|qy|d
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|he's he's going to be here for years.|S|s|e
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|and so um|F|fh|fh
me013|over years if he's if he's interested in you know voiced-unvoiced-silence he could do a lot.|S|s|s
me013|but if there if in fact there's something else that he could be doing would help us when we're we're sort of uh strapped for time.|S|s|s
me013|we have we we've you know only uh another another month or two to you know with the holidays in the middle of it um to to get a lot done.|S|s|s
me013|if we can think of something some piece of this that's going to be|D|s|cs
me013|the very fact that it is sort of just work and and it's running programs and so forth is exactly why it's possible that it some piece of could be handed to someone to do.|S|s|df
me013|because it's not|D|s|df
me013|uh yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|so that that's the question.|S|s|s
me013|and we don't have to solve it right this second.|S|s|s
me013|but if we could think of some some piece that's that's well defined that he could help with.|S|s|cs
me013|he's expressing a willingness to do that.|S|s|df
me018|what about training up a um a multilingual net?|Q|qo|cs
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
fn002|yes.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
fn002|maybe to huh put together the the label the labels between timit and spanish or something like that.|S|s|cs
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|so defining the superset.|S|s|cs
fn002|yes.|B|b|b
mn007|and uh joining the data.|S|s|cs
mn007|and huh|F|fh|fh
fn002|yeah.|S|s|bk
mn007|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me013|uh|F|h|h
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|that's something that needs to be done.|S|s|na
me013|in any event.|S|s|e
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so what we were just saying is that that um i was arguing for if possible coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research.|S|s|s
me013|because we we're we have a time crunch.|S|s|df
me013|and so uh if there's something that would would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece then we should think of that first.|S|s|cs
me013|see the thing with voiced-unvoiced-silence is i really think that that it's to do to do a a a a poor job is is pretty quick.|S|s|s
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|or you know a so so job.|S|s|e
me013|you can you can you can throw in a couple|D|s|s
me013|we know what what kinds of features help with it.|S|s|s
fn002|huh.|B|b|b
me013|you can throw something in.|S|s|s
me013|you can do pretty well.|S|s|s
me013|but i remember in fact when you were working on that.|S|s|s
me013|and you worked on for few months as i recall.|S|s|s
me013|and you got to say ninety three percent.|S|s|s
me013|and getting to ninety four really really hard.|S|s|s
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me018|another year.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|so|F|fg|fg
me013|um|F|fg|fg
me013|and the other tricky thing is since we are|D|s|s
me013|uh even though we're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size and and computational complexity uh clearly there's some limitation to it.|S|s|s
me013|so if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector say if we if we're trying to incorporate pitch information or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity or something this is another whole thing.|S|s|s
me013|take a while to develop.|S|s|s
me013|anyway it's a very very interesting topic.|S|s|s
me013|i mean one i think one of the a lot of people would say and i think dan would also uh that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information.|S|s|s
me013|uh we try to get spectral envelopes.|S|fh|fh
me013|reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail.|S|s|e
me013|but the harmonic detail does tell you something.|S|s|df
me013|like the fact that there is harmonic detail is is real important.|S|s|df
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|um|F|fh|fh
me013|so uh|F|fh|fh
me013|so i think|D|s|s
me013|yeah.|S|s|bk
me013|so that so the the other suggestion just came up was well what about having him work on the uh multi lingual superset kind of thing.|S|s|bs
me013|uh coming up with that and then you know training it training a net on that say um from from uh from timit or something.|S|fh|fh
me013|is that or uh for multiple databases.|S|s|s
me013|what what would you what would you think it would|D|qw|qw
me013|what would this task consist of?|Q|qw|qw
mn007|yeah it would consist in uh|D|s|bk
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|um creating the the superset.|S|fh|fh
mn007|and uh modifying the labels for matching the superset.|S|s|rt
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|uh creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages.|S|fg|fg
mn007|well creating the mappings actually.|S|s|s
me013|and then creating changing labels on timit?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|or on or on multiple language multiple languages?|Q|qrr|bu
fn002|no.|S|s|ar
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|the multiple language.|S|s|nd
mn007|with the three languages.|S|s|na
fn002|maybe for the other language.|S|s|cs
fn002|because timit have more phone.|S|s|df
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|uh.|F|fg|fg
me018|so you'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset.|S|s|s
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|from each language to the superset.|S|s|2
fn002|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|there's|D|%|%
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|carmen was talking about this sampa thing.|S|s|rt
me006|and it's um it's an effort by linguists to come up with um a machine readable i p a um sort of thing.|S|s|e
me006|right.|F|fh|fh
me006|and um they they have a web site that stephane was showing us that has um has all the english phonemes and their sampa correspondent um phoneme.|S|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|and then um they have spanish.|S|s|e
me006|they have german.|S|s|e
me006|they have all all sorts of languages um mapping mapping to the sampa phonemes.|S|s|e
me006|which|D|%|%
fn002|yeah.|S|s|bk
fn002|the the transcription though for albayzin is the transcription are of sampa the same uh how you say symbol that sampa appear.|S|s|s
me034|sampa?|Q|qy|bu
me034|what does sampa mean?|Q|qw|bu
me013|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me013|huh.|B|b|b
fn002|but i don't know if timit how is timit.|S|s|no
me034|so i mean|D|s|s
me013|what|D|%|%
me034|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
me013|go ahead.|S|s|co
me034|i was going to say does that mean i p a is not really international?|Q|qy|rt
me006|no it's it's saying|D|s|ar
me018|it uses special diacritics and stuff which you can't do with ascii characters.|S|s|ng
me006|can't print on ascii.|S|s|nd
fn002|yeah.|B|b|b
me034|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me018|so the sampa's just mapping those.|S|s|s
me034|got it.|S|s|bk
me013|what uh|D|qw|qw
me013|has o g i done anything about this issue?|Q|qy|rt
me013|do they have do they have any kind of superset that they already have?|Q|qy|rt
mn007|i don't think so.|S|s|nd
mn007|well they they they're going actually the the other way defining phoneme clusters apparently.|S|s|df
mn007|well|F|fh|fh
me013|aha.|S|s|bk
me013|that's right.|S|s|aa
me013|uh and that's an interesting way to go too.|S|s|s
me018|so they just throw the speech from all different languages together.|S|s|bu
me018|then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|i think they've not done it uh doing uh multiple language yet.|S|s|nd
mn007|but what they did is to training uh english nets with all the phonemes.|S|s|df
mn007|and then training it in english nets with uh kind of seventeen i think it was seventeen uh broad classes.|S|s|df
me018|automatically derived.|S|s|2
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah.|S|s|bk
me018|automatically derived broad classes or|D|qr|d
mn007|yeah i think so.|S|s|aa
me018|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|and yeah.|F|fh|fh
mn007|and the result was that apparently when testing on cross language it was better.|S|s|s
mn007|i think so.|S|s|t1
mn007|but hynek didn't add didn't have all the results when he showed me that.|S|s|df
mn007|so well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|but|D|%|%
me013|so that does make an interesting question though.|S|s|s
me013|is there's some way that we should tie into that with this.|S|s|s
me013|um.|F|fh|fh
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|i mean if if in fact that is a better thing to do should we leverage that rather than doing um our own?|Q|qy|qy
me013|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|so if if if they|D|s|s
me013|i mean we have we have the the trainings with our own categories.|S|s|s
me013|and now we're saying well how do we handle cross language.|S|s|s
me013|and one way is to come up with a superset.|S|s|cs
me013|but they are they're trying coming up with clustered.|S|s|s
me013|and do we think there's something wrong with that?|Q|qy|qy
mn007|i think that there's something wrong|D|s|na
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
mn007|well because|D|s|s
me013|what|D|%|%
mn007|well for the moment we are testing on digits.|S|s|df
mn007|and perhaps using broad phoneme classes.|S|s|df
mn007|it's it's okay for classifying the digits.|S|s|df
mn007|but as soon as you will have more words.|S|s|df
mn007|well words can differ with only a single phoneme and which could be the same uh class.|S|s|df
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
mn007|so|F|fh|fh
me013|right.|S|s|bk
me013|although you are not using this for the|D|s|bu
mn007|so i'm offering|D|s|s
me013|you're using this for the feature generation now.|S|s|bu
me013|not the|D|s|bu
mn007|yeah but you will ask the net to put one for the phoneme class.|S|s|aa
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|and so.|F|fh|fh
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|so you're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words?|Q|qy|bu
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|huh.|B|b|b
me034|fact most confusions are within the phone phone classes right?|S|s|bu
me034|i think uh larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents et cetera et cetera.|S|s|df
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|huh.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|this is another|D|s|na
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn007|another point.|S|s|na
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|so so maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff.|S|s|bu
me013|but that's what i thought they were going to|D|s|s
me006|right?|Q|qy|d
me013|did they not do that?|Q|qy|rt
me013|or|D|qrr|qrr
mn007|i don't think so.|S|s|na
mn007|well.|F|fh|fh
mn007|they were talking about perhaps.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fg|fg
mn007|but they|D|%|%
mn007|i|D|%|%
me013|they're talking about it.|S|s|bk
me013|but that's sort of a question whether they did.|S|s|nd
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|because that's that's the other route to go.|S|s|s
me013|instead of this you know|D|s|s
me006|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me006|superclass.|S|s|2
me013|instead of the the the the superclass thing.|S|s|m
me013|which is to take|D|s|e
me013|so suppose you don't really mark|D|s|s
me013|to really mark articulatory features you really want to look at the acoustics and and see where everything is.|S|s|s
me013|and we're not going to do that.|S|s|s
me013|so|F|fh|fh
me013|uh the second class way of doing it is to look at the uh phones that are labeled.|S|fh|fh
me013|and translate them into acoustic uh articulatory uh uh features.|S|s|s
me013|so it won't really be right.|S|s|s
me013|you won't really have these overlapping things and so forth.|S|s|e
me018|so the targets of the net are these|D|qy|bu
me013|but|F|fh|fh
me013|articulatory feature.|S|s|2
me018|articulatory features?|Q|qy|bu
me013|right.|S|s|aa
me018|but that implies that you can have more than one on at a time?|Q|qy|bu
me013|that's right.|S|s|aa
me018|uh.|F|fh|fh
me013|you either do that or you have multiple nets.|S|s|df
me018|okay.|F|fh|fh
me018|i see.|S|s|bk
me013|uh|F|fh|fh
me013|and um|F|fh|fh
me013|i don't know if our software this if the versions of the quicknet that we're using allows for that.|S|s|bu
me013|do you know?|Q|qy|rt
me006|allows for?|Q|qw|br
me013|multiple targets being one.|S|s|s
me006|oh.|S|s|bk
me006|um|F|fh|fh
me006|we have gotten soft targets to to work.|S|s|s
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so that that'll work.|S|s|s
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|so um|F|fg|fg
me013|that's another thing that could be done.|S|s|s
me013|is that we could we could uh just translate instead of translating to a superset just translate to articulatory features some set of articulatory features and train them with that.|S|s|cs
me034|um|F|fg|fg
me013|now the fact even though it's a smaller number it's still fine.|S|s|df
me013|because you have the the uh combinations.|S|s|df
me013|so in fact it has every you know it had has has every distinction in it that you would have the other way.|S|s|e
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|but it should go across languages better.|S|s|s
me018|we could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too.|S|s|cs
me018|we could i don't know if you had uh the phone labels you could replace them by their articulatory features.|S|s|cs
me018|and then feed in a vector with those uh things turned on based on what they're supposed to be for each phone.|S|s|cs
me018|to see if it if you get a big win.|S|s|e
me018|do you know what i'm saying?|Q|qy|f
me013|no.|S|s|ar
me018|so|F|h|h
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|i mean if your net is going to be outputting uh a vector of basically of|D|s|df
me018|well it's going to have probabilities.|S|s|e
me018|but let's say that they were ones and zeros.|S|s|s
me018|then and you know for each|D|s|s
me018|um|F|fh|fh
me018|i don't know if you know this for your testing data.|S|s|no
me018|but if you know for your test data you know what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned then you can just instead of going through the net just create the vector for each phone and feed that in.|S|s|df
me018|to see if that data helps.|S|s|e
me018|uh uh what made me think about this is i was talking with hynek and he said that there was a guy at a t and t who spent eighteen months working on a single feature.|S|s|s
me018|and because they had done some cheating experiments|D|s|e
me013|this was the guy that we were just talking that we saw on campus.|S|s|s
me013|so this was larry saul who did this did this.|S|s|e
me018|oh okay.|S|s|bk
me013|he used sonorants.|S|s|e
me018|right.|S|s|aa
me018|okay.|S|s|bk
me013|was what he was doing.|S|s|e
me018|right.|B|b|b
me013|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me018|and they they had done a cheating experiment or something right?|S|s|bu
me013|he he he didn't mention that part.|S|s|ng
me018|and determined that|D|s|s
me013|but|F|fh|fh
me018|well hynek said that that i guess before they had him work on this they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right it dramatically improved the result.|S|s|df
me013|i see.|S|s|bk
me013|okay.|B|b|b
me018|so i was thinking you know it made me think about this.|S|s|df
me018|that if it'd be an interesting experiment just to see you know if you did get all of those right.|S|s|e
me013|should be.|S|s|na
me013|because if you get all of them in there that defines all of the phones.|S|s|df
me013|so that's that's equivalent to saying that you've got got all the phones right.|S|s|e
me018|right.|B|b|b
me013|so if that doesn't help there's|D|s|cs
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me013|although yeah it would be make an interesting cheating experiment.|S|s|ba
me013|because we are using it in this funny way.|S|s|df
me013|where we're converting it into features.|S|s|e
me018|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|and then you also don't know what error they've got on the h t k side.|S|s|s
me018|you know?|Q|qy|d
me013|yeah.|B|b|b
me018|it sort of gives you your the best you could hope for kind of.|S|s|s
me006|huh.|B|b|b
me006|huh.|B|b|b
me006|i see.|D|s|bk
me034|the soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one though.|S|s|bu
me006|to sum up to one.|S|s|m
me034|right?|Q|qy|d
me034|so you can't really feed it like two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones.|S|s|s
me034|because it'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that for instance.|S|s|df
mn007|but perhaps you have the choice of the final|D|s|s
me006|right.|B|b|b
me006|nonlinearity?|Q|qy|2
mn007|uh|F|fh|fh
mn007|nonlinearity.|S|s|m
mn007|yeah.|S|s|aa
me006|um|F|h|h
mn007|is it always softmax?|Q|qy|bu
me006|it's|D|s|s
mn007|or|D|qrr|qrr
me006|no.|S|s|ar
me006|it's actually sigmoid x.|S|s|nd
mn007|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|for the|D|s|e
mn007|so if you choose sigmoid it's it's okay?|Q|qy|bu
me006|you|D|%|%
me013|did we just run out of disk?|Q|qy|rt
me006|um|F|h|h
me006|i think i think apparently the uh|D|s|s
me013|or|D|qrr|qrr
me034|why don't you just choose linear?|Q|qw|cs
me006|what's that?|Q|qw|br
me034|right?|Q|qy|d
me034|linear outputs?|Q|qy|cs
me006|linear outputs?|Q|qw|br
me034|isn't that what you'll want?|Q|qy|qy
me006|um|F|h|h
me034|if you're going to do a k l transform on it.|S|s|e
me006|right right.|S|s|bk
me006|right.|S|s|bk
me006|but during the training we would train on sigmoid x.|S|s|s
me034|oh you|D|%|%
me034|yeah.|B|b|b
me006|and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity.|S|s|s
me034|huh.|B|b|b
me013|so we're we're we're off the air?|Q|qy|bu
me013|or|D|qrr|qrr
me013|about to be off the air.|S|s|aap
