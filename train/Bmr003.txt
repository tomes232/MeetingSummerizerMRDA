me011|okay.|F|fg|fg
me011|so|F|fg|fg
me011|topic of this meeting is i want to talk a little bit about transcription.|S|s|rt
me011|um i've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services.|S|fh|fh
me011|and jane has been working on doing transcription.|S|s|s
me011|uh and so we want to decide what we're going to do with that.|S|fh|fh
me011|and then get an update on the electronics.|S|s|t
me011|and then uh maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools and so on.|S|s|cs
me011|um you know eventually we're probably going to want to distribute this thing.|S|fh|fh
me011|and we should decide how we're going to how we're going to handle some of these factors.|S|s|cs
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|distribute what?|Q|qw|d
me011|huh?|Q|qw|br
me025|the data.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|i mean so we're we're collecting a corpus.|S|s|s
me011|and i think it's going to be generally useful.|S|s|s
me011|i mean it seems like it's not a corpus which is uh has been done before.|S|s|s
me025|oh.|B|b|b
me011|and so i think people will be interested in having having it.|S|s|s
me028|using like audio d.v.d.'s or something like that?|Q|qy|d
me011|and so we will|D|s|s
me025|yes.|B|b|b
me011|excuse me?|Q|qw|br
me028|audio d.v.d.'s?|Q|qy|d
me011|well or something.|S|h|h
me011|yeah audio d.v.d.'s.|S|s|na
me011|c.d.'s.|S|s|s
me028|or|D|%|%
me011|you know.|F|fh|fh
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|tapes.|S|s|s
me011|and and so how we do we distribute the transcripts.|S|s|s
me011|how do we distribute the audio files.|S|s|s
me011|how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure.|S|s|s
me022|well i think i mean for that particular issue there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the l.d.c. for instance.|S|h|h
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me011|but but so should we do it in the same format as l.d. c?|Q|qy|qy
me011|and what does that mean to what we've done already?|Q|qw|qw
me025|right.|B|b|b
me025|the|D|%|%
me025|it's not so much the the logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution.|S|s|s
me022|right.|B|b|b
me011|right.|B|b|b
me011|so uh|F|fh|fh
me011|as it is it's sort of a ad hoc combination of stuff dan set and stuff i set up.|S|s|s
me011|which we may want to make a little more formal.|S|s|e
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|and the other thing is that um university of washington may want to start recording meetings as well.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
me025|in which case we'll have to decide what we've actually got so that we can give them a copy.|S|s|s
me028|a field trip.|S|s|s
me011|that's right.|S|s|bk
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i was actually thinking i wouldn't mind spending the summer up there.|S|s|s
me011|that would be kind of fun.|S|s|ba
me025|oh really?|Q|qy|bh
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|different for you.|S|s|s
me011|visit my friends and spend some time|D|s|df
me025|yes.|B|b|b
me011|well and then also i have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits.|S|s|s
me011|so i have a bunch of scripts with x. waves and some perl scripts and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are.|S|s|df
me011|and if u. u.w.'s going to do the same thing i think it's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well.|S|s|cs
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|and what i've done is pretty ad hoc.|S|s|df
me011|um so we might want to change it over to something a little more standard.|S|fh|fh
me022|huh.|B|b|b
me011|you know s.t.m. files or x.m.l. or something.|S|s|e
me028|and there's interest up there?|Q|qy|d
me011|what's that?|Q|qw|br
me028|there's interest up there?|Q|qy|d
me011|well they they certainly want to collect more data.|S|s|na
me011|and so they're applying i think i.b.m.|S|s|df
me011|is that right?|Q|qy|g
me025|i don't know.|S|s|no
me011|something like that.|S|s|s
me011|um for some more money to do more data.|S|fh|fh
me011|so we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings.|S|s|s
me011|they want to do an additional hundred or so hours.|S|s|s
me011|so they want a very large data set.|S|s|s
me011|um but of course we're not going to do that if we don't get money.|S|fh|fh
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|i see.|S|s|bk
me011|and i would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room.|S|s|df
me022|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me011|i mean one of the things morgan and i were talking about is we're going to get to know this room really well.|S|s|s
me011|the the acoustics of this room.|S|s|e
me028|including the fan.|S|s|s
me025|all about that.|S|s|s
me028|did you notice the fan difference?|Q|qy|rt
me011|including the fan.|S|s|m
me025|oh now you've touched the fan control.|S|s|s
me025|now all our data's going to be|D|s|s
me028|hear the difference?|Q|qy|d
fe008|oh that's better.|S|s|s
me025|yeah it's great.|S|s|aa
me011|oh it's enormous.|S|s|bk
fe008|that's better.|S|s|ba
me028|do you want to leave it off or not?|Q|qr|qr
me011|all the others have been on.|S|s|ng
me028|yeah the you sure?|Q|qy|d
me025|that's|D|%|%
me025|oh yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|you you think that|D|s|s
me025|absolutely.|S|s|na
me028|things after the then|D|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|this fan's wired backwards by the way.|S|s|s
me028|uh i think this is high speed here.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah it's noticeable.|S|s|s
me028|well not clear.|S|fh|fh
me028|maybe it maybe it isn't.|S|s|am
me025|well it's well like low is mid mid scale.|S|s|s
me028|that's right.|S|s|aa
me025|so it could be that it's not actually wired backwards.|S|s|df
me025|it's just that ambiguous.|S|s|df
me028|i was wondering also get ready whether the lights made any noise.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|there's definitely|D|s|s
me022|yeah a little bit.|S|s|aa
me025|oh they do.|S|s|na
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|high pitch hum.|S|s|df
me011|wow.|S|s|ba
me028|so do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future.|S|fg|fg
me011|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|just get a variety.|S|s|s
fe008|i think candles would be nice if they don't make noise.|S|s|cs
me025|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|they're very good.|S|s|ba
me022|it would you know it would really mean that we should do short meetings when you turn off the turn off the air conditioning.|S|s|cs
me011|carbon monoxide poisoning.|S|s|s
me028|short meetings.|S|s|bk
me028|that's right.|S|s|bk
me028|or|F|fh|fh
me028|yeah sort of|D|%|%
me022|got to finish this meeting.|S|s|j
me028|tear tear your clothing off to stay cool.|S|s|cs
me022|that's right.|S|s|bk
me028|actually the air the air conditioning's still working.|S|s|s
me028|that's just an auxiliary fan.|S|s|df
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me022|so|F|fg|fg
me022|um in addition to this issue about the u.w. stuff there was announced today uh via the l.d.c. um a corpus from i believe santa barbara.|S|fg|fg
fe008|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|i saw it.|S|s|s
fe008|i've been watching for that corpus.|S|s|s
me022|um of general spoken english.|S|fh|fh
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yep.|B|b|b
me022|and i don't know exactly how they recorded it.|S|s|no
me022|but apparently there's a lot of different styles of speech and what not.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|and|F|fh|fh
fe008|they had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have dat recorders.|S|s|s
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me022|so it is sort of far field stuff.|S|s|s
me022|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|i i assume so actually.|S|s|na
fe008|i hadn't thought about that.|S|s|df
fe008|unless they added close field later on.|S|s|df
fe008|but um i've listened to some of those data.|S|fh|fh
fe008|and i um i've been i i was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|oh okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|i'm glad to see that it got released.|S|s|s
me025|what's it sound like?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|so it's a very nice thing.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah i i wish|D|s|s
me011|i wish we had someone here working on adaptation.|S|s|cs
me011|because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting.|S|s|df
fe008|how do you mean do you mean mechanical adaptation or|D|qr|qr
me022|but it may be it may be useful in|D|s|s
me011|you know.|F|fh|fh
me011|no.|S|s|ar
me011|software.|S|s|df
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|to adapt the speech recognition.|S|s|df
me022|well what i was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing if it's far field stuff.|S|s|cs
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me022|right?|Q|qy|d
me022|in doing um some of our first automatic speech recognition models it may be useful to have that kind of data.|S|s|df
fe008|great idea.|S|s|ba
me022|because that's very different than any kind of data that we have so far.|S|s|df
me011|that's true.|S|s|aa
fe008|and and their recording conditions are really clean.|S|s|s
fe008|i mean i've i've heard i've listened to the data.|S|s|df
me011|well that's not good right?|S|s|ng
fe008|it sounds|D|s|s
me022|that's that's not great.|S|s|nd
fe008|well but what i mean is that um|D|s|df
me028|but far field means great distance?|Q|qy|bu
me028|i mean|F|fh|fh
me011|just these.|S|s|s
me028|not head mounted?|Q|qy|bu
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|and so that's why they're getting away with just two channels or something?|Q|qy|d
me028|or are they using multiple dats?|Q|qrr|qrr
fe008|um oh.|S|h|h
fe008|good question.|S|s|ba
fe008|and i can't answer it.|S|s|s
fe008|i don't know.|S|s|no
me011|well we can look into it.|S|s|cs
me022|no and their web their web page didn't answer it either.|S|fg|fg
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me022|so i'm uh was thinking that we should contact them.|S|s|cs
me022|so it's that's sort of a beside the point point.|S|s|s
me022|but|F|fh|fh
me011|so we can get that just with uh media costs.|S|s|bu
me028|still a point.|S|s|s
me022|right.|B|b|b
me011|is that right?|Q|qy|g
me022|uh in fact we get it for free.|S|h|h
me022|because they're distributing it through the l.d.c.|S|s|df
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
me011|great.|S|s|ba
fe008|yep.|B|b|b
me011|so that would be yeah that would be something to look into.|S|s|cs
me022|so i can i can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we're|D|s|cs
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|the other thing too is from from a|D|s|s
me011|well it's silly to do unless we're going to have someone to work on it.|S|s|nd
me011|so maybe we need to think about it a little bit.|S|s|ng
fe008|the other thing too is that their their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain.|S|s|s
me022|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|but they also mentioned that they have it time aligned.|S|s|s
fe008|i mean i i i saw that write up.|S|s|df
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did.|S|s|cs
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|absolutely.|S|s|na
me022|so so that we can we can compare.|S|s|cs
fe008|it's very nice.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|absolutely.|S|s|na
me011|okay why don't you go ahead and do that then eric?|S|s|bk
me022|all right i'll do that.|S|s|bk
me022|i can't remember the name of the corpus.|S|s|no
me022|it's|D|s|s
fe008|c.s.a.e.|S|s|s
fe008|corpus of spoken american english.|S|s|df
me022|s.|D|%|%
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah i've been i was really pleased to see that.|S|s|s
fe008|i knew that they they had had some funding problems in completing it.|S|s|s
fe008|but um|F|fh|fh
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|well they're|D|%|%
fe008|this is clever.|S|s|ba
me022|apparently this was like phase one.|S|s|s
fe008|got it through the l.d.c.|S|s|s
me022|and there's still more that they're going to do apparently or something like that.|S|s|s
fe008|great.|S|s|ba
me022|unless of course they have funding issues.|S|s|s
fe008|great.|S|s|ba
me022|and then then it they may not do phase two.|S|s|s
me022|but from all the web documentation it looked like oh this is phase one.|S|s|df
fe008|super.|S|s|ba
me022|whatever that means.|S|s|s
fe008|super.|S|s|ba
fe008|great.|S|s|ba
fe008|yeah that i mean they're really well respected in the linguistics side too and the discourse area.|S|s|bk
fe008|and|F|fh|fh
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|so this is a very good corpus.|S|s|ba
me022|but it would also maybe be helpful for liz if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues you know looking at some of this data and then|D|s|df
me022|you know.|F|fh|fh
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me022|so when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her.|S|s|cs
me011|actually that's another thing i was thinking about is that maybe jane should talk to liz to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked.|S|s|cs
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me022|maybe we should have a big meeting meeting.|S|s|cs
me025|sure.|S|s|aa
me025|of course.|S|s|na
me028|that would be a meeting meeting meeting?|Q|qy|d
me011|a meeting meeting meeting.|S|s|bk
me022|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting.|S|s|j
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me022|oh.|B|b|b
me022|right.|B|b|b
me011|um|F|fh|fh
me022|but maybe we should find some day that liz uh liz and andreas seem to be around more often.|S|s|cs
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me022|so maybe we should find a day when they're going to be here and and morgan's going to be here.|S|s|cs
me022|and we can meet.|S|s|cs
me022|at least this subgroup.|S|s|e
me022|i mean not necessarily have the u. dub people down.|S|s|df
me011|well i was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the u. dub to see|D|s|cs
me022|we need we need to talk to them some more.|S|s|s
me011|you know say this is what we're thinking about for our transcription if nothing else.|S|s|s
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|so well shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then?|Q|qy|rt
me022|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|let's.|S|s|na
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|so since that's what we're talking about.|S|s|s
me011|what we're using right now is a tool um from this french group called transcriber.|S|s|s
me011|that seems to work very well.|S|s|s
me011|um|F|fh|fh
me011|so it has a uh nice useful tcl t.k. user interface.|S|s|e
me011|and uh|F|fh|fh
me028|this is the process of converting audio to text?|Q|qy|d
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me028|and this requires humans just like the the s.t.p. stuff?|Q|qy|d
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|right right.|S|s|aa
me011|so we're we're at this point only looking for word level.|S|s|s
me011|so all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time and then write down what was said within it.|S|s|s
me011|and identify the speaker.|S|s|e
me011|and so the things we that we know that i know i want are the text the start and end and the speaker.|S|s|s
me011|but other people are interested in for example stress marking.|S|s|s
me011|and so jane is doing primary stress um stress marks as well.|S|s|e
me011|um and then things like repairs and false starts and filled pauses and all that other sort of stuff we have to decide how much of that we want to do.|S|s|s
fe008|i did include a uh a certain first pass.|S|s|s
fe008|my my view on it was when you have a repair then uh it seems|D|s|s
fe008|i mean we saw there was this presentation in the one of the speech group meetings about how|D|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|and i think liz has done some stuff too on that that it uh that you get it bracketed in terms of like|D|s|s
fe008|well if it's parenthetical which i know that liz has worked on then uh you'll have different prosodic aspects.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|and then also if it's a if it's a repair where they're like what i just did then it's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance.|S|s|s
fe008|the start to to the finish.|S|s|e
fe008|and uh it's a little bit deceptive if you include the the pre repair part.|S|fh|fh
fe008|and sometimes or of it's in the middle.|S|s|e
fe008|anyway so what i was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs.|S|fg|fg
fe008|which isn't uh very time-consuming.|S|s|e
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|is there already some sort of plan in place for how this going to be staffed or done?|Q|qy|rt
me028|or is it real is that what we're talking about here?|Q|qrr|qrr
me011|well.|F|h|h
me011|that's part of the thing we're talking about.|S|s|aap
me011|so what we wanted to do was have jane do basically one meeting's worth.|S|s|df
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|you know forty minutes to an hour.|S|s|e
fe008|as a pilot study.|S|s|s
me011|and|F|fh|fh
me028|yourself?|Q|qy|d
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|as a pilot study.|S|s|df
me028|it this is this is like five times real time or ten times real time.|S|s|bu
me011|ten times about.|S|s|s
me011|is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take.|S|s|s
me011|and then also what tools we would use.|S|s|e
me011|and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we going to do it.|S|s|s
me028|and so you make jane do the first one.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me028|so then she can decide oh we don't need all this stuff.|S|s|s
me028|just the words are fine.|S|s|s
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me025|that's right.|B|b|b
fe008|i want to hear about these uh we have a you were continuing with the transcription conventions for|D|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me011|so so one one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it.|S|s|s
me011|and apparently that's happened in the past.|S|s|df
me011|and i think that's probably the right way to do it.|S|s|ba
me011|um it will require a post pass.|S|fh|fh
me011|i mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it's been done correctly.|S|s|df
me011|but i just can't imagine that we're going to get anything that much better from a commercial one.|S|s|s
me011|and the commercial ones i'm sure will be much more expensive.|S|s|s
me028|can't we get joy to do it all?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|no that's|D|s|ar
me011|yeah right.|S|s|ng
me028|is wasn't that what she was doing before?|Q|qy|df
me011|we will just get joy and jane to do everything.|S|s|j
me028|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|but you know that's what we're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money.|S|s|s
me028|right.|B|b|b
me011|and uh|F|fh|fh
me011|duh again|D|%|%
fe008|i object to that characterization!|S|s|fe
me025|oh really?|Q|qy|bh
me011|i meant joy.|S|s|j
me011|and so again i have to say are we recording.|S|s|s
fe008|oh thank you.|S|s|ft
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|and then say uh morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have.|S|s|s
me028|right.|B|b|b
me028|well the answer is zero.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me028|there's a reason why he's resisted.|S|s|j
me028|but|F|fh|fh
me011|well if it's zero then we can't do any transcription.|S|s|s
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me011|i mean because we're we|D|s|df
me025|i have such a hard name.|S|s|ba
me011|i mean i i can't imagine us doing it ourselves.|S|s|df
me028|well we already we already we already have a plan in place for the first meeting.|S|s|s
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me028|that's|D|%|%
fe008|well there is|D|s|s
fe008|yeah really.|S|s|na
fe008|there is also the other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks you can you could get people to to um to do it in exchange.|S|s|s
me028|well but seriously i i mean morgan's obviously in a bind over this.|S|s|ng
me011|right.|B|b|b
me028|and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory.|S|s|cs
me028|which is we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|and that's that's the best we can do.|S|s|ba
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|to not do anything until we get money is is ridiculous.|S|s|ba
me011|right.|B|b|b
me025|right.|B|b|b
me011|right.|B|b|b
me028|we're not going to do any get anything done if we do that.|S|s|df
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so at any rate jane was looking into the possibility of getting students.|S|fg|fg
me011|at is that right?|Q|qy|g
me011|talking to people about that?|Q|qy|d
fe008|i'm afraid i haven't made any progress in that front yet.|S|s|ng
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|i should've sent email and i haven't yet.|S|s|s
me011|yeah right.|S|s|bk
me011|so uh|F|fg|fg
me028|do so until you actually have a little experience with what this this french thing does we don't even have|D|s|s
fe008|and i do have|D|s|s
me011|she's already done quite a bit.|S|s|nd
fe008|i have a bunch of hours.|S|s|nd
me028|oh we have.|S|s|bk
me028|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|so that's where you came up with the the ten x. number?|Q|qy|d
me028|or is that really just a guess?|Q|qrr|qrr
fe008|actually that's the the one people usually use ten x. .|S|s|s
fe008|and i haven't really calculated|D|s|df
me022|how fast are you?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|how fast am i?|Q|qw|bk
fe008|i haven't done a|D|s|s
me028|yeah|D|%|%
fe008|see i've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that that are you know and and stuff like you know how much|D|s|s
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me022|right.|S|s|bk
fe008|there's some interesting human factors problems like yeah what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh transcribe it the most quickly.|S|s|s
fe008|because then you know you get like if you get a span of five words that's easy.|S|s|e
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|but then you have to take the time to mark it.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and then there's the issue of it's easier to hear it right the first time if you've marked it at a boundary instead of somewhere in the middle.|S|s|s
fe008|because then the word's bisected or whatever.|S|s|df
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|and|F|fh|fh
fe008|and|F|fh|fh
fe008|so i mean i've been sort of playing with uh different ways of because i'm thinking you know i mean if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take.|S|s|s
me028|does uh this tool you're using is strictly|D|qy|qy
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|it doesn't do any speech recognition does it?|S|s|s
me011|no.|S|s|aa
fe008|no it doesn't.|S|s|na
fe008|but what a super tool.|S|s|ba
fe008|it's a great environment.|S|s|ba
me028|but but is there anyway to to wire a speech recognizer up to it?|Q|qy|qy
me028|and actually run it through|D|s|e
fe008|that's an interesting idea.|S|s|ba
fe008|hey!|S|s|bk
me011|we've we've thought about doing that.|S|s|s
me011|but the recognition quality is going to be horrendous.|S|s|ng
me028|well a couple things.|S|s|s
me028|first of all the time marking you'd get you could get by a tool.|S|s|df
me025|wow.|D|s|ba
me025|that's true.|S|s|aa
me028|and so if the if if the issue|D|s|s
fe008|that's interesting.|S|s|ba
me028|uh i'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts.|S|s|df
me028|you know|D|%|%
me011|most of those are done by a person.|S|s|ng
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|i know i know that.|S|s|na
me028|no i understand.|S|s|aa
me028|and in a lot of them you see typos and things like that.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|but it but it occurs to me that it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch no matter how wonderful the tool is.|S|s|cs
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah we|D|fg|fg
me028|but if if there was a way to merge the two|D|s|cs
me022|well i mean but sometimes it's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right|D|h|h
fe008|that'd be fun.|S|s|ba
me011|i mean we've talked about it.|S|s|s
me011|but|F|fh|fh
me022|i mean it depends on the error rate.|S|s|s
me022|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|well but but again the timing is for should be for free.|S|s|s
me028|the timing should be|D|s|s
me022|but we don't care about the timing of the words.|S|s|ng
me028|well i thought you just that's said that was a critical issue.|S|s|bu
fe008|no.|S|s|ar
me011|we don't care about the timing of the words just of the utterances.|S|s|nd
fe008|uh the the boundary.|S|s|s
me022|we cut it|D|s|s
me025|we don't we don't know actually.|S|s|no
fe008|boundary.|S|s|r
me025|we haven't decided which which time we care about.|S|s|df
me025|and that's kind of one of the things that you're saying is like you have the option to put in more or less timing data.|S|s|bs
me025|and uh in the absence of more specific instructions we're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is.|S|s|s
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so so what what she's done so far is sort of more or less breath not breath groups sort of phrases continuous phrases.|S|fg|fg
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|and so um that's nice because you you separate when you do an extract you get a little silence on either end.|S|fh|fh
me011|so that seems to work really well.|S|s|s
fe008|that's ideal.|S|s|ba
me011|um|F|fh|fh
fe008|although i was i you know the alternative which i was sort of experimenting with before i ran out of time recently was um that you know if it were like an arbitrary segment of time pre marked.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|because it does take time to put those markings in.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|it's really the the interface is wonderful.|S|s|ba
fe008|because you know the time it takes is you listen to it and then you press the return key.|S|s|df
fe008|but then you know it's like uh you press the tab key to stop the flow and and uh the return key to to put in a marking of the boundary.|S|s|s
fe008|but you know obviously there's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|so it's slightly delayed.|S|s|s
fe008|so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here.|S|s|s
fe008|so that takes time.|S|s|s
fe008|now if it could all be pre marked at some you know good|D|s|s
me028|are are those delays adjustable?|Q|qy|qy
me011|huh.|B|b|b
me028|those delays adjustable?|Q|qy|d
me028|see a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay.|S|s|df
me028|and and so when you by the time you click it it'll be right on because it'll go back in time to put the|D|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|uh not in this case.|S|s|nd
me025|it could do that.|S|s|na
me025|couldn't it?|Q|qy|g
me011|we could program that pretty easily.|S|s|s
fe008|it has other|D|s|s
me011|couldn't we dan?|Q|qy|g
me011|yeah mister t.c.l.|S|s|e
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh interesting point.|S|s|ba
me025|i would have thought so.|S|s|na
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|uh interesting point.|S|s|ba
fe008|okay that would make a difference.|S|s|bk
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me011|but um|F|fg|fg
fe008|i mean it's not bad.|S|s|ba
me011|but if we tried to do automatic speaker i.d.|S|s|s
fe008|but it does take twice.|S|s|s
me011|i mean because primarily the markings are at speaker change.|S|s|df
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|but|D|%|%
me025|but we've got we've got the most channel data.|S|s|ng
me011|but that would be|D|s|s
me025|we'd have to do it from your signal.|S|s|s
me025|right.|B|b|b
fe008|oh good point!|S|s|ba
me025|i mean we've we've got we've got a lot of data.|S|s|df
fe008|uh.|S|s|bk
fe008|we've got volume.|S|s|na
me011|yeah i guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it.|S|s|bk
me025|right.|S|s|bk
me025|but the chances are if if we're talking about collecting ten or a hundred hours which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe|D|s|s
me028|if|D|%|%
me011|but|F|fg|fg
me028|if we can go from ten x. to five x. we're doing a big|D|s|s
me011|we're going to need we're going to need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools and validate the tools the do the to to do all this anyway.|S|s|df
me022|right.|B|b|b
me022|so maybe|D|%|%
fe008|wow.|S|s|ba
fe008|but but it|D|fg|fg
me025|if we're just doing silence detection|D|s|s
me011|i knew you were going to do that.|S|s|s
me011|just saw it coming.|S|s|s
fe008|i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
fe008|i wish you had told me.|S|s|s
fe008|wish you'd told me.|S|s|r
me028|put put it on your sweater.|S|s|cs
fe008|at what part?|Q|qw|d
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|i'm all right.|S|s|s
me025|um it seems like|D|fg|fg
me025|well.|F|fh|fh
me025|uh i don't know.|S|s|no
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|i mean it it's it's maybe like a week's work to get to do something like this.|S|s|s
me025|so forty or fifty hours.|S|s|e
fe008|could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker?|Q|qy|rt
me022|right.|B|b|b
fe008|and the the format's really transparent.|S|s|s
me025|sure.|S|s|aa
me022|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|it's just a matter of a very clear|D|s|df
fe008|it's x.m.l. isn't it?|S|s|bu
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
fe008|it's very i mean i looked at the the file format and it's just it has a a time a time indication and then something or other and then an end time or something or other.|S|s|s
me022|so|F|fg|fg
me022|maybe maybe we could try the following experiment.|S|s|cs
me022|take the data that you've already transcribed.|S|s|cs
fe008|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me022|and|F|fh|fh
me028|is this already in the past or already in the future?|Q|qrr|qrr
me022|already in the past.|S|s|s
me028|you've already you've already done some?|Q|qy|d
me022|she she's done one she's one|D|s|s
fe008|yes i have.|S|s|aa
me011|she's she's done about half a meeting.|S|s|na
me028|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me028|okay.|S|s|bk
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me028|good.|S|s|ba
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me011|about half?|Q|qy|d
me022|i'm|D|s|s
fe008|i'm not sure if it's that's much.|S|s|no
fe008|but anyway enough to work with.|S|s|s
me022|right.|S|s|aa
me025|several minutes.|S|s|s
me022|um|F|fg|fg
me022|and and throw out the words.|S|s|cs
me022|but keep the time markings.|S|s|cs
me022|and then go through i mean and go through and and try and re transcribe it given that we had perfect boundary detection.|S|s|cs
fe008|okay.|S|s|aa
fe008|good idea.|S|s|ba
me022|and see if it see if it see if it feels easier to you.|S|s|cs
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|and forgetting all the words because you've been|D|s|cs
fe008|yeah that's what i was thinking.|S|s|bk
fe008|i'd i'd be cheating a little bit with familiarity effect.|S|s|s
me022|yeah i mean uh that's part of the problem is is that what we really need is somebody else to come along.|S|s|bk
me025|well no you should do it you should do it do it again from scratch.|S|s|cs
me025|and then do it again at the boundaries.|S|s|cs
me025|so you do the whole thing three times.|S|s|cs
me025|and then we get|D|s|s
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|no.|S|s|ar
fe008|now there's a plan.|S|s|s
me028|and then then since we need some statistics do it three more.|S|s|cs
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|and so you'll get you'll get down to one point two x. by the time you get done.|S|s|df
fe008|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|i'll do that tomorrow.|S|s|cc
fe008|i should have it finished by the end of the day.|S|s|j
me028|no but the thing is the fact that she's she's did it before just might give a lower bound.|S|fg|fg
me028|that's all.|S|s|s
fe008|exactly.|S|s|aa
me028|uh which is fine.|S|s|e
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|right.|S|s|aa
me028|it's|D|%|%
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|and if the lower bound is nine x. then it's a waste of time.|S|s|df
me022|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|well but there's an extra problem which is that i didn't really keep accurate|D|s|s
fe008|uh it wasn't a pure task the first time.|S|s|df
me025|oh.|S|s|bk
fe008|so uh it's going to be an upper bound in in that case.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and it's not really strictly comparable.|S|s|s
fe008|so i think though it's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that i haven't yet done yet in the same meeting could use it on the next segment of the text.|S|s|cs
me025|the point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from?|Q|qw|qw
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me025|or the boundaries.|S|s|e
me011|yeah one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to|D|s|bk
fe008|well but couldn't i do it for the next|D|qy|qy
me025|we we we could get fake|D|s|s
fe008|oh i see what you mean.|S|s|bk
me011|i mean that's easy enough.|S|s|s
me011|i could do that.|S|s|s
fe008|well but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a specific channel wouldn't they?|S|s|s
me025|that would be the automatic boundaries.|S|s|s
me022|no no no no.|S|s|ar
me011|no no.|S|s|ar
me022|you want to know given given a perfect human segmentation i mean you want to know how well|D|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|i mean the the question is is it worth giving you the segmentation.|S|s|s
fe008|oh i see what you mean.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i mean that that's easy enough.|S|s|s
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me011|i could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words and time yourself on it.|S|s|s
me028|a little double blind ear kind of thing.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
fe008|i see.|S|s|bk
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|so it that might be worth doing.|S|s|s
fe008|that's good.|S|s|ba
fe008|i like that.|S|s|ba
me011|that would at least tell us whether it's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool that will compute the segmentations.|S|s|df
me028|and the thing to keep in mind too about this tool guys is that sure you can do the computation for what we're going to do in the future.|S|s|s
me022|right.|B|b|b
me028|but if if u.w.'s talking about doing two or three or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool then obviously there's a real multiplier there.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe008|and the other thing too is with with speaker identification.|S|s|s
fe008|if if that could handle speaker identification that's a big deal.|S|s|s
me025|well it|D|%|%
me028|well use it.|S|s|co
me022|right.|S|s|bk
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me028|yeah that's why we bought the expensive microphones.|S|s|df
fe008|yeah i mean that's a nice feature.|S|s|bk
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me025|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|that's a major that's like one of the two things that|D|s|s
me022|i mean there's going to there's going to be in the meeting like the reading group meeting that we had the other day that's it's going to be a bit of a problem.|S|s|s
me025|okay.|B|b|b
me022|because like i wasn't wearing a microphone.|S|s|df
me022|and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones.|S|s|df
me025|yes.|B|b|b
me028|but you didn't say anything worth while anyway right?|S|s|s
me011|that|D|%|%
me025|right.|B|b|b
me011|that'll|D|%|%
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|that's pretty much true.|S|s|na
me022|but|F|fh|fh
me011|it might save ninety percent of the work though.|S|s|s
me022|but yes.|S|s|aa
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|so i i need to we need to look at what what the final output is.|S|fg|fg
me025|but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks and the speaker and speaker identity without putting in the words.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i've already become pretty familiar with the format.|S|s|s
fe008|that'd be so great.|S|s|ba
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|it would be easy.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|we didn't finish the the part of work already completed on this.|S|s|s
me011|if you'd tell me where it is huh?|S|s|s
fe008|did we?|Q|qy|g
fe008|i mean you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe008|and i guess you've mentioned in your progress report or status report that you had written a script to convert it into|D|fh|fh
fe008|so i when i the it's quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like you know if if adam spoke to um to just say a. colon.|S|s|s
fe008|like who could be you know i mean at the beginning of the line.|S|s|e
me025|huh.|S|s|bk
fe008|and e. colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing uh indicating the speaker i.d.|S|s|s
fe008|so and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that uh would indicate speaker i.d.|S|s|s
fe008|if that's clear.|S|s|e
me011|it's pretty cute.|S|s|ba
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|but at any rate.|S|s|s
fe008|it's perl script.|S|s|s
me011|so um|F|fg|fg
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me011|so so i think the guess at ten x. seems to be pretty standard.|S|s|s
me011|everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription.|S|s|df
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|using using stone|D|s|s
me028|using stone age tools.|S|s|s
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|using using stone age tools.|S|s|m
fe008|yeah well that's true.|S|s|bk
me011|i mean i looked at cyber transcriber.|S|s|s
fe008|but|F|fh|fh
me011|which is a service that you send an audio file.|S|s|e
me011|they do a first pass speech recognition.|S|s|e
me011|and then they they do a clean up.|S|s|e
me011|but it's going to be horrible.|S|s|s
me011|they're never going to be able to do a meeting like this.|S|s|s
fe008|what just approximately what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever?|Q|qw|qw
me028|right.|B|b|b
me025|no.|S|s|aa
me011|well for cyber transcriber they don't quote a price.|S|h|h
me011|they want you to call and and talk.|S|s|df
me011|so for other services um they were about thirty dollars an hour.|S|fh|fh
fe008|of of tape?|Q|qy|d
fe008|or of action?|Q|qrr|d
me011|thirty|D|%|%
me011|so yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|for thirty dollars an hour for of their work.|S|s|s
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
fe008|oh of their|D|s|bk
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
me011|so so if it's ten times it's three hundred dollars an hour.|S|s|e
me022|so that's three that's three hours.|S|s|s
me028|did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for uh t. v?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me022|right.|B|b|b
me011|no.|S|s|ar
me028|because they usually at the end of the show they'll tell what the name of the company is the captioning company that's doing it.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe008|interesting.|S|s|ba
me011|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|so so my my search was pretty cursory.|S|fg|fg
me011|it was just a net search.|S|s|df
me011|and uh so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that.|S|fh|fh
me028|well you know the the thing the thing about this is thinking kind of maybe a little more globally than i should here.|S|fg|fg
me028|but that really this could be a big contribution we could make.|S|s|cs
me028|uh i mean we've been through the s.t.p. thing.|S|s|df
me028|we know what it what it's like to to manage the manage the process.|S|s|df
me028|and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we're looking for here.|S|s|df
me028|but it was a it was a big hassle.|S|s|s
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|i mean uh you know they they constantly could've reminding people and going over it.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|and clearly some new stuff needs to be done here.|S|fh|fh
me028|and it's it's only our time where our of course includes dan dan and you guys.|S|s|s
me028|it doesn't include me at all.|S|s|s
me028|uh|F|fh|fh
me028|just seems like|D|s|s
me025|yeah i mean i don't know if we'd be able to do any thing to help s.t.p. type problems.|S|s|bk
me025|but certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than|D|s|s
me028|why?|Q|qw|qw
me028|because they wanted a lot more detail?|Q|qy|d
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me025|because they had because they only had two speakers right?|S|s|df
me025|i mean the the segmentation problem is|D|s|s
me028|only had two.|S|s|s
me011|trivial.|S|s|2
me011|they had two speakers over the telephone.|S|s|s
me028|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me028|so what took them so long?|Q|qw|rt
me011|um mostly because they were doing much lower level time.|S|h|h
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so they were doing phone and syllable transcription as well as uh word transcription.|S|s|df
me028|right.|B|b|b
me028|right.|B|b|b
me022|right.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|and so we're we decided early on that we were not going to do that.|S|s|df
me028|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|but there's still the same issue of managing the process of of reviewing and keeping the files straight and all this stuff that which is clearly a hassle.|S|s|s
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|and so so what i'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour.|S|fg|fg
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i think that's the ball park.|S|s|df
me011|there were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents.|S|s|df
me011|twenty eight to thirty two dollars an hour.|S|s|e
me022|and|D|%|%
me022|who knows if they're going to be able to manage multiple channel data?|Q|qw|qw
me025|yeah they won't.|S|s|bk
me011|they won't.|S|s|s
me025|they they'll refuse to do it.|S|s|df
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|we'll have to mix them.|S|s|df
me022|right.|B|b|b
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and then there's the problem also that|D|s|s
me025|no but i mean they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material.|S|fg|fg
me025|that's not what they're quoting for right?|S|s|s
me028|well they might they might quote it|D|s|am
me011|yes it is.|S|s|aa
me025|for quoting meetings?|Q|qy|d
me011|several of them say that they'll do meetings and conferences and and so on.|S|s|s
me025|wow.|S|s|ba
me011|none of them specifically said that they would do speaker i.d. or speaker change mark.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people something like that.|S|s|s
me011|they all just said transcription.|S|s|df
me025|yeah yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me011|well the the way it worked is it it was scaled.|S|s|s
me011|so what they had is if it's an easy task it costs twenty four dollars an hour.|S|s|df
me011|and it will take maybe five or six times real time.|S|s|df
me011|and what they said is for the hardest tasks bad acoustics meeting settings it's thirty two dollars an hour.|S|s|df
me011|and it takes about ten times real time.|S|s|df
me025|i see.|S|s|bk
me011|so i think that we can count on that being about what they would do.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|it would probably be a little more.|S|s|s
me025|right.|B|b|b
me011|because we're going to want them to do speaker marking.|S|s|df
me028|a lot of companies i've worked for the uh the person leading the meeting the executive or whatever would sort of go around the room and and mentally calculate how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|in university atmosphere you get a little different thing.|S|s|s
me028|but|F|fh|fh
me028|you know it's a lot like he's worth fifty an hour.|S|s|e
me028|he's worth|D|s|s
me028|and so so here we're thinking well let's see if the meeting goes another hour it's going to be another thousand dollars.|S|s|s
me028|you know?|Q|qy|d
me028|it's|D|%|%
me011|yep.|S|s|bk
me028|so so everybody talk really fast.|S|s|co
me011|we have to have a short meeting.|S|s|s
fe008|that's very interesting.|S|s|ba
me011|stop talking!|S|s|co
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|let's get it over with.|S|s|co
fe008|talk slowly but with few words.|S|s|co
me011|and clearly.|S|s|2
me028|and|D|%|%
me025|that's right.|B|b|b
me028|only talk when you're pointed to.|S|s|co
fe008|there you go.|S|s|s
me011|content words only.|S|s|co
fe008|we could have some telegraphic meetings.|S|s|cs
fe008|that might be interesting.|S|s|ba
me025|yeah it'd be cheap.|S|s|bk
me025|cheap to transcribe.|S|s|e
me011|so|F|fg|fg
me011|but at any rate so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out.|S|s|s
me028|and we're talking about doing how many hours worth of meetings?|Q|qw|d
me011|thirty or forty.|S|s|s
me028|so thirty or forty thousand dollars.|S|s|bu
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|well for ten thousand dollars.|S|s|s
me022|so meanwhile|D|fg|fg
me028|oh.|B|b|b
me028|what well it was thirty times|D|s|s
me025|three hundred.|S|s|2
me011|three hundred dollars an hour.|S|s|s
me028|oh i'm sorry.|S|s|fa
me028|three hundred.|S|s|s
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me028|i got an extra factor of three there.|S|s|df
me011|right.|B|b|b
me022|so it's thirty dollars an hour essentially right?|S|s|bu
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|but we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour.|S|s|s
me022|and the question is what's the difference|D|s|s
me025|how how much lower are they?|Q|qw|rt
me022|or eight dollars.|S|s|bsc
me022|what do you know what the going rate is?|Q|qy|rt
me022|it's it's on the order of eight to ten.|S|s|df
fe008|i think that would give us a a good good estimate.|S|s|s
me022|i think.|S|s|e
me022|but i'm not sure.|S|s|no
fe008|i'd i'd say|D|s|s
me025|ten.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah i was going to say eight.|S|s|s
fe008|you'd say ten?|Q|qy|bu
me022|let's say ten.|S|s|co
me025|yeah give them a break.|S|s|na
me028|these are not for engineering graduate students right?|S|s|s
me022|because it's easier.|S|s|df
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|these are linguistics grad students.|S|s|df
me028|that's right.|S|s|bk
me022|yeah i i i don't i don't know what the i don't know what the standard|D|s|no
me011|six.|S|s|cs
me022|but there is a standard pay scale.|S|s|s
me022|i just don't know what it is.|S|s|no
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|s|aa
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me022|um|F|fh|fh
me022|so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it's cheaper to to do graduate students.|S|s|bs
fe008|and there's another aspect too.|S|s|s
me011|i mean that's why i said originally that i couldn't imagine sending it out's going to be cheaper.|S|s|s
me025|no it isn't.|S|s|aa
fe008|the other thing too is that uh if they were linguistics they'd be you know in terms of like the post editing uh uh content wise they might be easier to handle.|S|s|s
me025|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|because they might get it more right the first time.|S|s|df
me011|and also we would have control of i mean we could give them feedback.|S|s|s
me011|whereas if we do a service it's going to be limited amount.|S|s|df
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
me025|yep yep.|S|s|aa
fe008|good point.|S|s|ba
me011|i mean we can't tell them you know for this meeting we really want to mark stress.|S|s|df
me025|yep.|B|b|b
me011|and for this meeting we want|D|s|s
me025|no.|B|b|b
fe008|good point.|S|s|ba
me011|and and they're not going to provide they're not going to provide stress.|S|s|df
me011|they're not going to provide repairs.|S|s|df
me011|they're not going to provide|D|s|s
me011|they they may or may not provide speaker i.d.|S|s|am
me011|so that we would have to do our own tools to do that.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|just hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students.|S|s|s
me011|i just|D|s|s
me028|who who's the person in charge?|Q|qw|qw
me028|who's going to be the steve here?|Q|qw|qw
me028|you?|Q|qy|d
me011|i hope it's jane.|S|s|s
fe008|oh interesting.|S|s|ba
me011|is that all right?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|um now would this involve some manner of uh monetary compensation?|Q|h|h
fe008|or would i be the voluntary uh coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking?|Q|qrr|qrr
me011|um i would imagine there would be some monetary involved.|S|h|h
me011|but we'd have to talk to morgan about it.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|out of out of adam's pocket.|S|s|j
me022|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me028|you know it just means you have to stop working for dave.|S|s|j
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|see?|Q|qy|d
fe008|i don't want to stop working for dave.|S|s|nd
me028|that's why dave should have been here.|S|s|df
me028|to protect his people.|S|s|e
me011|well i would like you to do it.|S|s|s
fe008|oh cool.|S|s|ba
me011|because you have a lot more experience than i do.|S|s|df
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me011|but if if that's not feasible i will do it with you as an advisor.|S|s|cs
me028|we'd like you to do it.|S|s|s
fe008|we'll see.|S|s|s
me028|and we'd like to pay you.|S|s|s
me028|not being morgan though it's|D|s|df
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me022|right.|B|b|b
me025|we'd like to.|S|s|s
fe008|well|F|fg|fg
me025|unfortunately.|S|s|s
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah six dollars an hour.|S|s|j
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah i see.|S|s|bk
me022|that's a|D|s|s
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|and and then|D|%|%
fe008|boy if i wanted to increase my income i could start doing the transcribing again.|S|s|j
me025|yeah that's right.|S|s|bk
me028|and and be sure and say would you like fries with that when you're thinking about your pay scale.|S|s|j
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|i see.|S|s|bk
fe008|good.|S|s|ba
fe008|yeah no that i i would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that.|S|s|bk
me011|okay.|B|b|b
me011|more.|S|s|2
fe008|more.|S|s|m
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|um any more on transcript we want to talk about?|Q|fg|fg
me025|what so what are you so you've done some portion of the first meeting.|S|s|bu
fe008|yes.|S|s|aa
me025|and what's your plan?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|to carry on doing it?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|what well you know what i thought was right now we have|D|s|s
fe008|so i gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions.|S|s|s
fe008|he made his uh suggestion of improvement.|S|s|s
me025|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|the the it's a good suggestion.|S|s|ba
fe008|so as far as i'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now.|S|s|s
fe008|and so my next plan would be|D|s|s
me025|what what do they what do they cover?|Q|qw|rt
fe008|they're very minimal.|S|s|s
fe008|so it would be good to just to summarize that.|S|s|s
fe008|so um one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and this is a way which meshes well with with uh making it so that uh you know on the at the.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|boy it's such a nice interface.|S|s|ba
fe008|when you when you get the um you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it an indication of uh|D|s|e
fe008|if you have two speakers overlapping in a in a single segment you see them one displayed one above each other.|S|s|e
fe008|and then at the same time the top part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing.|S|s|e
fe008|you can clip click on individual utterances and it'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal and play it for you.|S|s|e
fe008|and you can you can work pretty well between those two these two things.|S|s|s
me028|is there a limit to the number of speakers?|Q|qy|rt
me011|um the user interface only allows two.|S|h|h
me025|huh.|S|s|bk
me011|and so if if you're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two.|S|s|df
me011|but my script can handle any.|S|s|s
me011|and their save format can handle any.|S|s|s
me011|and so um using this the convention that jane and i have discussed you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want.|S|fh|fh
me028|do is this a uh university project?|Q|qy|rt
me028|this is the french software right?|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|french.|S|s|na
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|their academic.|S|s|na
me011|and they're they've been quite responsive.|S|s|s
me011|i've been exchanging emails on various issues.|S|s|df
me025|oh really?|Q|qy|bh
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|uh did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers?|Q|qy|rt
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
me011|and they said that's on in in the works for the next version.|S|s|df
me028|good.|S|s|ba
me028|good.|S|s|ba
me022|oh so multichannels.|S|s|s
me011|multichannels was also|D|s|s
me011|well they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels.|S|s|s
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me011|so i think that's unlikely to happen.|S|s|s
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|do you know what they're using it for?|Q|qy|rt
me028|why'd they develop it?|Q|qw|rt
me011|for this exact task?|Q|qy|d
me028|are they linguists?|Q|qy|qy
me022|for transcription.|S|s|s
me022|it's|D|%|%
me028|but i mean are they are they linguists or are they speech recognition people?|Q|qr|qr
me011|i think they're linguists.|S|s|s
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
me025|linguists.|S|s|s
me022|they're they have some connection to the l.d.c.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|because the l.d.c. has been advising them on this process.|S|s|df
me022|the linguistic data consortium.|S|s|e
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|um|F|fh|fh
me022|so|F|fh|fh
me022|but apart from that.|S|s|s
me022|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me011|it's also all the source is available.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me022|right.|B|b|b
me028|great.|S|s|ba
me011|if you if you speak t.c.l.t.k.|S|s|e
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|and they have they've actually asked if we are willing to do any development.|S|s|s
me011|and i said well maybe.|S|s|s
me028|good.|S|s|ba
me022|right.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|so if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay which actually i think is a great idea um i'm sure they would want that incorporated back in.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah i do too.|S|s|na
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|their pre lay.|S|s|s
me025|pre lay.|S|s|bk
fe008|pre lay.|S|s|bk
me011|way.|S|s|s
fe008|well and they've thought about things.|S|s|s
fe008|you know i mean they they do have|D|s|s
fe008|so you have when you when you play it back um it's it is useful to have uh a a break mark to segment it.|S|s|s
fe008|but it wouldn't be strictly necessary.|S|s|s
fe008|because you can use the uh the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off.|S|s|df
fe008|i mean it'll stop the speech you know if if you press a tab.|S|s|df
fe008|and um|F|fh|fh
fe008|and so|F|fh|fh
fe008|uh that's a nice feature.|S|fh|fh
fe008|and then also once you've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit.|S|s|s
fe008|you could do it like multiply.|S|s|s
fe008|until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit.|S|s|e
me028|loop it?|Q|qy|cs
fe008|or or|F|fh|fh
me028|you you know there's also the the user interface that's missing.|S|s|s
fe008|or|F|fh|fh
me028|it's missing from all of our offices.|S|s|df
me028|and that is some sort of analog input for something like this.|S|s|df
me028|it's what audio people actually use of course.|S|s|s
me028|it's something that when you move your hand further the sound goes faster past it.|S|s|df
me028|like fast forward.|S|s|e
me028|you know like a joy stick.|S|s|e
me028|or a uh you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that.|S|fh|fh
fe008|why that's|D|%|%
fe008|that's not something i wanted to have happen.|S|s|nd
me028|no but i'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for for video or for audio where you you need to do this.|S|s|bk
fe008|i see.|S|s|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth rather than hitting tab and backspace and carriage return and enter and things like that.|S|s|s
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me025|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog|D|s|s
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|so i mean those are things we could do.|S|s|s
me011|but|F|fh|fh
me011|i i just don't know how much it's worth doing.|S|s|no
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i mean we're just going to have|D|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|right.|B|b|b
fe008|i i agree.|S|s|aa
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|they they have several options.|S|s|s
fe008|so uh you know i mentioned the looping option.|S|s|s
fe008|another option is it'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary.|S|s|s
fe008|and then to get to the next boundary you just press tab.|S|s|e
fe008|and it goes on to the next unit.|S|s|e
me011|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|i mean it's very nicely thought out.|S|s|ba
me028|cool.|S|s|ba
fe008|they thought about|D|s|s
me022|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|and also it'll go around the the uh|D|s|s
fe008|i want to say cursor.|S|s|s
fe008|but i'm not sure if that's the right thing.|S|s|no
me011|point.|S|s|2
me011|whatever.|S|s|s
fe008|anyway you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you uh work within.|S|s|s
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|and but so in terms of the the conventions then uh basically uh it's strictly orthographic.|S|s|s
fe008|which means with some provisions for uh uh colloquial forms.|S|s|df
fe008|so if a person said because instead of because then i put a an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in in double angle brackets what the full lexical item would be.|S|s|e
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|and this could be something that was handled by a table or something.|S|s|s
fe008|but i think to have a convention marking it as a nonstandard or i don't mean standard but a a a uh orthographic uh whatever.|S|s|s
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|non-canonical.|S|s|2
fe008|going to or want to.|S|s|e
fe008|you know the same thing.|S|s|s
fe008|and and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as nonstandard pronunciation.|S|s|s
me022|how are you handling backchannels?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|backchannels.|S|s|bk
fe008|um|F|fh|fh
me011|comments?|Q|qy|d
fe008|you know|D|%|%
fe008|oh yes.|S|s|bk
fe008|there was some|D|s|s
fe008|in my view when when you've got it densely overlapping um i didn't worry about i didn't worry about specific start times.|S|s|s
me022|what do you mean by|D|qw|qw
fe008|i sort of thought that this is not going to be easily processed anyway.|S|s|s
fe008|and maybe i shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said no or you know uh immediate.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and instead just sort of rendered within this time slot there were two people speaking during part of it.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|and if you want more detail figure it out for yourself.|S|s|s
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me011|well i think what what eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech.|S|s|ng
fe008|was sort of the way i felt.|S|s|e
me011|right?|Q|qy|d
me022|well yeah.|S|s|aa
me022|what i mean is i mean when somebody says uhhuh in the middle of uh a|D|s|df
me011|yep.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|that happened very seldom.|S|s|s
me022|oh because i was i was listening to dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking.|S|s|df
me028|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me028|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe008|oh well thank you dan.|S|s|ft
me022|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|appreciate it.|S|s|ft
fe008|well if it if there was a word like right you know then i i would indicate that it happened within the same time frame.|S|s|s
me011|yeah there's an overlapping mark.|S|s|bk
me022|and|F|fh|fh
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|but wouldn't say exactly when it happened.|S|s|s
me028|i'll be right back.|S|s|s
me025|i transcribed a minute of this stuff.|S|s|s
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me025|and there was a lot of overlapping.|S|s|s
me025|it was|D|%|%
fe008|a lot of overlapping yeah.|S|s|na
me011|well there's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end.|S|s|na
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|huge amounts.|S|s|e
me025|it was at the beginning.|S|s|s
me011|um when when no one when we're not actually in the meeting and we're all sort of separated and and doing things.|S|fh|fh
me011|but even during the meeting there's a lot of overlap.|S|s|s
me011|but it it's marked pretty clearly.|S|s|s
me011|um some of the backchannel stuff jane had some comments.|S|s|s
me011|and but i think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting.|S|s|df
me011|and so i think that that often often you can't tell.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|well that's true.|S|s|na
fe008|that's another issue.|S|s|s
me011|i mean jane had had comments like uh to who who the person was speaking to.|S|s|e
me022|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|only when it was otherwise going to be puzzling.|S|s|aap
fe008|because he was in the other room talking.|S|s|df
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|yeah but someone who uh was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|that's true.|S|s|aa
me022|right.|B|b|b
me011|or when dan said i i wasn't talking to you.|S|s|df
fe008|i know.|S|s|bk
me028|so you take a bathroom break in the middle and and keep your head|D|qy|d
me011|you have to turn off your mike.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|oh you do?|Q|qy|bh
fe008|well he was|D|s|s
me025|you don't have to.|S|s|nd
fe008|so so he was checking the meter levels.|S|s|s
fe008|and and we were handling things while he was labeling the the whatever it was.|S|s|s
fe008|the p.d. a?|Q|qy|bu
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
me025|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
fe008|and and so he was in sort of you were sort of talking.|S|s|s
fe008|you know.|F|fh|fh
fe008|so i was saying like and i could label this one left.|S|s|s
fe008|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|and he and he said i don't see anything.|S|s|s
fe008|and he said he said i wasn't talking to you.|S|s|s
fe008|or it wasn't it didn't sound quite that rude.|S|s|df
me011|but|F|fg|fg
fe008|but really no uh you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he's saying|D|s|s
me011|but when you when you listen to it|D|s|s
me028|it was a lot funnier if you were there though.|S|s|s
fe008|uh yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|i know.|S|s|bk
fe008|well you'll see.|S|s|s
me011|well what what it what happens is if you're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like dan is just being a total totally impolite.|S|s|s
fe008|you can listen to it.|S|s|s
fe008|oh i thought it was you who was.|S|s|s
fe008|no well but you were you were asking off the wall questions.|S|fg|fg
me011|um|F|fh|fh
me011|but but if you knew that that i wasn't actually in the room and that dan wasn't talking to me it it became okay.|S|s|s
me025|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|so|D|%|%
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|and that's that's where i added comments.|S|s|s
me022|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|the rest of the time i didn't bother with who was talking to who.|S|s|s
fe008|but but this was unusual circumstance.|S|s|df
me028|so this is this is going to go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape right?|S|s|bu
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
me011|right.|S|s|aa
fe008|well and part of it was funny uh reason was because it was a mixed signal.|S|s|s
fe008|so you couldn't get any clues from volume that you know he was really far away from this conversation.|S|s|df
me011|stereo.|S|s|2
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|you couldn't do that symmetrically in any case.|S|s|s
me025|no.|S|s|aa
me011|oh.|F|fg|fg
me011|i should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other.|S|s|s
me011|i have a auto gain mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal.|S|s|df
fe008|that's a good idea.|S|s|ba
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|and that seems to work really well for the uh transcribers.|S|s|df
me028|great.|S|s|ba
fe008|but i thought it would be you know i i didn't want to add more contextual comments than were needed.|S|s|s
fe008|but that it seemed to me clarified that the what was going on.|S|s|df
fe008|and uh|F|fh|fh
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|so normalization.|S|s|s
me022|so|F|fg|fg
me022|i was just going to ask uh so i just wanted to sort of finish off the question i had about backchannels.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|if that's okay.|S|s|e
me025|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me022|which which was so say somebody's talking for a while.|S|s|e
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|and somebody goes uhhuh in the middle of it and and and what not.|S|s|s
me022|does the conversation come out from the or the person who's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there's this little tiny segment of this other speaker?|Q|qy|rt
me022|or does it does the fact that there's a backchannel split the the the it in two?|Q|qrr|qrr
fe008|okay my my focus was to try and maintain content continuity and uh to keep it within what he was saying.|S|s|bk
fe008|like i wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible.|S|s|e
fe008|so if someone said uhhuh in the middle of a of someone's uh uh intonational contour i i indicated it as like what you just did.|S|s|df
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|then i indicated it as a segment which contained this utterance plus an overlap.|S|s|df
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
me025|but that's but there's only one there's only one time boundary for both speakers.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me025|right?|Q|qy|d
fe008|and you know it could be made more precise than that.|S|s|s
fe008|but i just thought|D|s|s
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me022|i see.|S|s|bk
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|right.|B|b|b
me028|i think whenever we use these speech words we should always do the thing like you're talking about accent.|S|s|cs
fe008|oh i see what you mean.|S|s|bk
fe008|and then hesitation.|S|s|j
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|okay.|F|fg|fg
fe008|and so then uh in terms of like words like uh and um i just wrote them.|S|s|s
fe008|because i figured there's a limited number.|S|s|df
fe008|and i keep them to a uh limited set.|S|s|s
fe008|because it didn't matter if it was huh or um you know versus um.|S|s|df
fe008|so i just always wrote it as u. m. .|S|s|s
fe008|and uhhuh you know u.h.u.h.i. mean like a set of like five.|S|s|s
me025|okay.|B|b|b
fe008|but in any case i didn't mark those.|S|s|s
me022|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me025|uhhuh is u.h.h.u.h. .|S|s|df
me025|uhuh is u.h.u.h.|S|s|df
fe008|i'd be happy with that.|S|s|s
fe008|that'd be fine.|S|s|na
fe008|it'd be good to have that in the in the conventions what's to be used.|S|s|cs
me022|huh uh.|S|s|ar
me011|i i did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end.|S|s|s
me011|we should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker.|S|s|cs
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|that's a fine idea.|S|s|ba
me011|then so question mark colon is fine for that.|S|s|cs
fe008|that's a fine idea.|S|s|ba
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|okay.|S|s|aa
me028|well what's that mean?|Q|qw|qw
me011|just say silence.|S|s|e
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|you mean|D|qy|d
me011|no one's talking.|S|s|s
me028|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|silence all around.|S|s|bu
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me028|yep.|S|s|bk
fe008|so i had|D|s|s
me025|we have to mark those?|Q|qy|d
fe008|i|D|%|%
me025|don't they can't we just leave them unmarked?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|well you see that's possible too.|S|s|na
me011|well i want to leave the marked|D|h|h
me011|i don't want them to be part of another utterance.|S|s|ng
me025|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|so you just you need to have the boundary at the start and the end.|S|s|df
me025|sure.|S|s|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|now that's refinement that uh maybe it could be handled by part of the part of the script or something more.|S|s|s
me025|uh yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|it seems like|D|s|s
me025|it seems like the uh the transcription problem would be very different if we had these automatic speaker detection turn placing things.|S|s|s
me025|because suddenly|D|s|df
me025|i mean i don't know.|F|fh|fh
me025|actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels.|S|s|s
me025|but assuming we can get around that somehow.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|well you were saying i think it can read|D|s|s
me011|it can read and write as many as you want.|S|s|s
me011|it's just that|D|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|but what if you want to edit it?|Q|qw|rt
me025|right?|Q|qy|d
me025|i mean the point is we're going to generate this transcript with five five tracks in it but with no words.|S|s|df
me025|someone's going to have to go in and type in the words.|S|s|s
me025|um|F|fh|fh
me025|and if there are five five people speaking at once|D|s|s
me011|right it's|D|s|bk
me011|i didn't explain it well.|S|s|s
me011|if we use the the little the conventions that jane has established i have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention.|S|s|s
me025|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|yes.|S|s|bk
fe008|which allows five.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe008|and it can be edited after the fact.|S|s|bu
fe008|can't it also?|Q|qy|g
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
fe008|but their but their format if you wanted to indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route then they a window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers.|S|s|bu
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|right.|S|s|bk
me028|but you're saying that by the time you call it back in to from their saved format it opens up a window window with five speakers?|Q|qy|bu
fe008|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|but|F|fh|fh
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me028|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|that is sort of|D|s|s
me028|they didn't quite go the whole|D|s|s
me011|it's just user interface.|S|s|s
me011|so it's|D|%|%
me028|yeah they didn't go the whole route.|S|s|bk
me028|did they?|Q|qy|g
me011|the the the whole saved the saved format and the internal format all that stuff handles multiple speakers.|S|s|s
me028|they just|D|s|s
me011|it's just there's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two.|S|s|df
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me028|so your your script solves doesn't it solve all our problems.|S|s|bu
fe008|and that|D|s|s
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me028|because we're always going to want to go through this preprocessing.|S|s|df
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me028|uh assuming it works.|S|s|e
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
fe008|and that works nicely because this so quick to enter.|S|s|s
fe008|so i wouldn't want to do it through the interface anyway adding which worry who the speaker was.|S|s|s
me011|yep.|S|s|bk
me028|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|right.|B|b|b
me028|good.|S|s|ba
fe008|and then uh let's see what else.|S|s|s
fe008|oh yes.|S|s|bk
fe008|i i wanted to have|D|s|s
fe008|so sometimes a i|D|s|s
fe008|in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions it's it isn't just words coming out.|S|s|s
fe008|it's like there's some purpose for an utterance.|S|s|s
fe008|and sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it.|S|s|s
fe008|but you want to show that it's continued at a later point.|S|s|s
fe008|so i have i have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person's utterance continues.|S|s|s
fe008|and then when it uh catches back up again then there's an arrow dash.|S|s|s
fe008|and then you have the opposite direction to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus|D|s|s
fe008|um|F|fh|fh
fe008|sometimes we had the situation which is you know which you which you get in conversations of someone continuing someone else's utterance.|S|s|s
me025|huh.|S|s|bk
fe008|and in that case i did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde to indicate that it was continuation.|S|s|s
fe008|but it wasn't|D|s|s
fe008|oh i guess i did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things.|S|s|bk
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|because it's the speakers the same.|S|s|df
fe008|and then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker uh continuation.|S|s|s
me025|huh.|S|s|bk
me011|oh.|B|b|b
fe008|but just you know the arrows showing continuation of a thought.|S|s|s
me025|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe008|and then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing|D|s|s
fe008|you know at the end of this unit you'd know what happened later.|S|s|s
fe008|and that was like this person continued.|S|s|df
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|and you'd be able to look for the continuation.|S|s|df
me025|but the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers.|S|s|s
me025|like if you if you only have one person if you only have one thought that's continuing across a particular time boundary you just need one arrow at each end.|S|s|df
me025|and if it's picked up by a different speaker it's picked up by a different speaker.|S|s|df
me025|the time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that and they sort of swap.|S|s|df
me025|i guess if you have more than one thread going then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me022|how often does that happen do you think?|Q|qw|qw
me025|hopefully not very much.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah i didn't use it very often.|S|s|aa
me011|especially for meetings.|S|s|s
me028|it|D|%|%
me011|i mean if if you were just recording someone's day it would be impossible you know.|S|s|df
me011|if you were trying to do a remembrance agent.|S|s|e
me011|but i think for meetings it's probably all right.|S|s|s
me022|huh.|B|b|b
me011|but a lot of these issues i think that for uh from my point of view where i just want to do speech recognition and information retrieval it doesn't really matter.|S|s|ba
me025|sure.|S|s|bk
me025|i know.|S|s|bk
me011|but other people have other interests.|S|s|s
me025|but it it does feel it does feel like it's really in there.|S|s|s
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|i you know i did this i did this transcription.|S|s|s
me025|and i marked that i marked it with ellipsis.|S|s|s
me025|because it seemed like there was a difference.|S|s|df
me025|it's something you wanted to indicate that it that i this was the end of the phrase.|S|s|df
me025|this was the end of that particular transcript.|S|s|df
me025|but it was continued later.|S|s|df
me025|and i picked up with an ellipsis.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
fe008|excellent.|S|s|ba
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|i didn't have the equal not equal thing.|S|s|s
fe008|well that's you know i mean i that's why i didn't i didn't do it.|S|s|na
fe008|i mean that's why i thought about it and and re ev|D|s|s
me025|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|and it didn't do i didn't do it in ten times the the time.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me011|well so anyway are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically?|Q|fg|fg
me011|is that something you want to do dan?|Q|qy|rt
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me025|but it's something that i feel we definitely ought to do.|S|s|s
me011|no.|S|s|bk
fe008|i also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed.|S|s|rt
fe008|do you have a sense of how long|D|qy|qy
me025|yeah it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute.|S|s|aa
me025|but i didn't have any i didn't even have a|D|s|s
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me025|i was trying to get transcriber to run but i couldn't.|S|s|s
me025|so i was doing it by typing into a text file and trying to fit.|S|s|df
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me025|it was horrible.|S|s|ba
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me028|so thirty to one's what you got?|Q|qy|bu
me025|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
me028|so that's new upper limit?|Q|qy|bu
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|well i mean that's that's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other|D|s|s
me025|is it|D|qy|qy
me011|but i think for a first try that's about right.|S|s|s
me022|so so if we hired a if we hired a whole bunch of dan's|D|s|s
me028|that's right.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|it was actually it was quite it was a|D|s|s
me011|if we hire an infinite number of dan's|D|s|s
fe008|and there's always a warm up thing of|D|s|s
me028|it'd|D|%|%
me025|it|D|%|%
me011|are we going to run out of disk space by the way?|Q|qy|qy
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|good.|S|s|ba
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me028|doesn't it beep in the other room when you're out of disk space?|Q|qy|j
me022|so|F|fg|fg
me022|is there|D|qy|qy
me011|no.|S|s|ar
me022|maybe we should consider also um starting to build up a web site around all of these things.|S|s|cs
me025|web site.|S|s|bk
me025|that's great!|S|s|ba
me022|i know.|S|s|bk
me011|dan's sort of already started.|S|s|ng
me025|we could have like business to business e. commerce as well.|S|s|cs
me022|that's right.|S|s|bk
me022|no but|D|fg|fg
me022|it would be interesting it would be interesting to see|D|s|cs
me011|can we sell banner ads?|Q|qy|j
me028|get get paid for click throughs?|Q|qy|d
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|what a good idea.|S|s|ba
me011|that's how we could pay for the transcription.|S|s|j
me022|i want to introduce|D|s|s
me022|i i want to introduce the word snot-head into the conversation at this point.|S|s|j
me025|we can have|D|s|s
me028|you want to word that won't be recognized?|Q|qy|d
me022|you see because uh because|D|s|df
me022|exactly.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh i don't think so.|S|s|nd
me022|um|F|fg|fg
me022|no.|F|fg|fg
me022|the|D|%|%
me011|hey what about me?|Q|fg|fg
me022|what|D|%|%
me022|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|you're the one who raised the issue.|S|s|s
me022|no.|S|s|ar
me022|all right.|S|s|bk
me022|see here's here's here's my thought behind it.|S|s|s
me022|which is that uh the the stuff that you've been describing jane i one has to of course indicate um is very interesting.|S|s|df
fe008|all right.|S|s|bk
me022|and|F|fh|fh
me022|i'd like to be able to to pore through you know the the types of conventions that you've come up with and stuff like that.|S|s|s
me025|yeah yeah yeah.|B|b|b
me022|so i would like to see that kind of stuff on the web.|S|s|cs
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|now the alternative to a web site would be to put it in doctor speech.|S|s|cs
me025|yes.|B|b|b
me025|yes.|S|s|bk
fe008|because because what i have is a soft link to my transcription that i have on my account.|S|s|df
me022|either's fine.|S|s|na
me025|we|D|%|%
fe008|but it doesn't matter.|S|s|s
me011|we can do it all.|S|s|na
me025|we can do it all.|S|s|bk
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me025|we can write|D|s|cs
fe008|web site's nice.|S|s|ba
me025|oh.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|then you have to you have to do an h.t. access.|S|s|s
me028|web site's what?|Q|qw|d
me025|we could actually maybe we could use the t.c.l. plug in.|S|s|cs
me025|oh man.|S|s|s
fe008|ooo!|D|%|%
fe008|he's committed himself to something.|S|s|s
me022|ow.|S|s|ba
me022|see he said the word t.c.l. and and that's|D|s|s
me028|but he does such a good job of it.|S|s|s
me028|he should be allowed to to you know do it.|S|s|s
fe008|i know i know.|S|s|na
me025|i know.|S|s|bk
me025|but that but i|D|%|%
me025|right.|S|s|bk
me025|but i should be allowed to.|S|s|na
me025|but|F|fh|fh
me028|if you just did a crappy job nobody would want you to do it.|S|s|df
me025|i i shouldn't be allowed to by by my own by my according to my own priorities.|S|s|nd
me025|all right.|F|fg|fg
me025|let's look at it anyway.|S|s|co
me025|so definitely we should we should have some kind of access to the data.|S|s|cs
me022|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|and we have we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around.|S|s|s
me011|i have several.|S|s|e
me011|and dan has a few.|S|s|e
me025|yes.|S|s|bk
fe008|uh.|S|s|bk
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me022|so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things.|S|s|cs
me011|and|D|%|%
fe008|nice.|S|s|ba
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me025|well yeah.|S|fg|fg
me022|the|D|%|%
me025|well so then|D|s|s
me011|try try to consolidate.|S|s|cs
me011|i mean who wants to do that though?|Q|qh|df
me025|the other side is yeah.|S|s|s
me022|uh right.|S|s|bk
me011|no one wants to do that.|S|s|df
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me025|right.|S|s|aa
me025|that's the problem.|S|s|na
me028|why?|Q|qw|qw
me028|what what's what's the issue?|Q|qw|qw
me022|well we could put we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt.|S|h|h
me025|no one owns the project.|S|s|s
me028|no one what?|Q|qw|br
me025|no one owns the project.|S|s|r
me011|yeah i own the project.|S|s|bk
me011|but i don't want to do it.|S|s|s
me025|no one wants to own the project.|S|s|s
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me028|well do but|D|fg|fg
me011|it's mine!|S|s|fe
me011|all mine!|S|s|fe
me025|well then you have to do the web site.|S|s|s
me028|but|D|%|%
me025|you know it's like it's that simple.|S|s|s
me011|wah hah hah hah hah hah.|D|%|%
me028|but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking?|Q|qw|qw
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me028|you're talking about writing h.t.m.l. right?|S|s|bu
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah i i'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that that is legible and pleasant to read and up to date and et cetera et cetera et cetera.|S|s|s
me028|but is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier?|Q|qy|rt
me011|absolutely.|S|s|na
me011|it's it's absolutely against the law to use a tool.|S|s|na
me028|you|D|%|%
me011|i haven't found any tools that i like.|S|s|s
me011|it's just as easy to use to edit the raw h.t.m.l. as anything else.|S|s|s
me028|no kidding?|Q|qy|bh
me025|that's obviously not true.|S|s|nd
me025|but you have|D|s|s
me011|it's obviously not true.|S|s|m
me028|no it's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes.|S|s|bk
me025|right.|S|s|aa
me028|the question is what is what's he looked at.|S|s|s
me025|that's true.|S|s|aa
fe008|which one do you use jim?|Q|qw|qw
me028|i use something called trellix.|S|s|s
fe008|oh that's right.|S|s|bk
fe008|i remember.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|and it|D|%|%
fe008|which produces also site maps.|S|s|bu
me028|it's very powerful.|S|s|s
me011|now i guess if i were if i were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites i might want to.|S|s|s
me011|but|F|fh|fh
me011|most of the web sites i do aren't that complex.|S|s|s
fe008|well would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use?|Q|qr|qr
me011|but|F|fh|fh
me022|no i think|D|s|ar
me011|i think both.|S|s|s
me022|i think mostly internal.|S|s|s
me011|mostly in house.|S|s|s
me025|that's right.|S|s|aa
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|well yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|but what does internal mean?|Q|qw|ng
me025|no both.|S|s|ar
me028|i mean you're leaving.|S|s|df
me028|people at u.w. want to look at it.|S|s|df
me028|i mean it's it's internal until|D|s|s
me022|right.|S|s|bk
me022|internal to the project.|S|s|s
me028|i see.|S|s|bk
fe008|we could do an h.t. access which would accommodate those things.|S|s|cs
me025|i i i i|D|%|%
me011|okay.|F|fg|fg
me011|well|F|fg|fg
me011|send me links.|S|s|co
me011|and i|D|%|%
me011|send me pointers rather.|S|s|bsc
me011|and i'll put it together.|S|s|cc
me025|i'm not|D|%|%
fe008|wonderful.|S|s|ba
me025|okay.|S|s|bk
me025|i'm not sure how how important that distinction is.|S|s|s
me025|i don't think we should say oh it's internal.|S|s|s
me025|therefore we don't have to make it very good.|S|s|s
me025|i mean you can say oh oh it's internal.|S|s|s
me022|no.|S|s|ar
me022|no.|S|s|ar
me025|therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing.|S|s|s
me025|but i think the point is to try and be coherent and make it a nice presentation.|S|s|s
me028|right.|B|b|b
me028|i agree.|S|s|aa
fe008|yeah it is true that is it benefits to|D|s|aa
me028|because you're going to have to do the work sooner or later.|S|s|df
fe008|that's right.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
fe008|i mean it's the early on.|S|s|s
me028|even if it's just writing things up.|S|s|e
me011|yep.|B|b|b
me028|you know?|Q|qy|d
fe008|it's a great idea.|S|s|ba
me011|okay.|F|fg|fg
me011|um let's move on to electronics.|S|fh|fh
me025|uh.|S|s|bk
me028|we we out of tape out of disk?|Q|qy|d
me025|great.|S|s|ba
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me025|we're doing we're doing great.|S|s|nd
me028|i i was looking for the actual box i plan to use.|S|s|s
me028|uh|F|fh|fh
me028|but i all i could i couldn't find it at the local store.|S|s|s
me028|but this is the the technology it's actually a little bit thinner than this.|S|s|s
me028|and it's two by two by one.|S|s|df
me028|and it would fit right under the right under the the the lip.|S|s|df
me011|yeah does everyone know about the lip on the table?|Q|qy|rt
me028|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|it's great.|S|s|ba
me028|there's a lip in these tables.|S|s|na
fe008|nice.|S|s|ba
me028|and it i especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded.|S|s|s
me011|clink!|D|%|%
me028|let's see see what it does to the|D|s|co
me011|clink!|D|%|%
me028|but this was the uh just just to review.|S|s|s
me028|and i also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table and sort of push them around.|S|s|s
me011|and and crinkle them and|D|s|2
fe008|and that being a diagram.|S|s|s
me025|what?|Q|qw|br
me025|what?|Q|qw|br
me028|that that's the six tables that we're looking at.|S|s|s
me028|these six tables here with with little boxes sort of uh in the middle here.|S|s|e
fe008|okay.|S|s|bk
me025|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|which would|D|s|s
me028|i mean the the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway.|S|s|s
me028|i'll show you the the|D|s|cc
me028|this is the table cross section.|S|s|s
me028|i don't know if people realize what they're looking at.|S|s|no
me025|you trying to screw up the the microphones?|Q|qy|d
me011|yes.|S|s|aa
me025|i mean|D|%|%
me011|he is.|S|s|na
me011|absolutely.|S|s|na
me028|well why not?|Q|qh|qh
me028|i mean because this is what's going to happen.|S|s|df
me028|you got plenty of data.|S|s|df
me028|i won't come to your next meeting.|S|s|cc
me028|and and|F|fg|fg
me028|and so this is the box's|D|s|s
me011|get your paper off my p.d. a!|S|s|co
fe008|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|let let the record show that this is exhibit two b. .|S|s|co
me028|that's right.|S|s|bk
me028|or not to be.|S|s|j
me028|yeah yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|uh the box uh there's a half inch lip here.|S|fg|fg
me028|the box is an inch thick.|S|s|s
me028|so it hangs down a half an inch.|S|s|s
me028|and so the the two head set jacks would be in the front.|S|s|s
me028|and then the little l.e.d. to indicate that that box is live.|S|s|s
me028|the the important issue about the l.e.d. is the fact that we're talking about eight of these total which would be sixteen channels.|S|s|s
me028|and uh even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture they're not all going to be used for this.|S|fh|fh
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me028|so there'd be a subset of them used for obviously just use the ones at this end for for this many.|S|s|df
me028|so|F|fg|fg
me028|excuse me.|S|s|fa
me028|you'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live so the l.e.d. wouldn't be on.|S|s|s
me025|right.|S|s|aa
me025|all the lights.|S|s|s
me028|so if you're plugged in it doesn't work and the l.e.d. is off that's that's a tip off.|S|s|e
fe008|that's good.|S|s|ba
me028|and then the uh would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and obviously collect these cables at the same time.|S|s|s
me028|uh so this this notion of putting down the p.z.m.'s and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table.|S|fh|fh
me028|or or|F|fh|fh
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me011|well we want to do that definitely.|S|s|na
me028|right.|B|b|b
me028|right.|B|b|b
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me028|and so the you we just epoxy them down or something.|S|s|s
me028|big screw into the table.|S|s|e
me025|velcro.|S|s|cs
me028|uh|F|fh|fh
me028|and even though there's eight cables they're not really very big around.|S|s|s
me028|so my model is to get a a piece of|D|s|s
me011|sleeve.|S|s|2
me028|yeah that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the wires into that's sort of shaped like that cross section.|S|s|bk
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me011|okay not just sleeve them all?|Q|qy|d
me028|i'm i'm i'm going up and then i'm going down.|S|s|s
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me011|and leave them loose?|Q|qy|d
fe008|that looks like a semi circle.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|it's like a it's a sleeping policeman.|S|s|s
fe008|sleeping|D|s|bk
me025|speed bump!|S|s|fe
me011|whoo!|S|s|fe
me025|speed bump.|S|s|j
me028|yeah it's like a speed|D|s|aa
fe008|speed bump.|S|s|bk
me011|a sleeping policeman.|S|s|s
fe008|that's good.|S|s|ba
fe008|there we go.|S|s|s
me028|and they're they're actually extruded from plastic.|S|s|s
me011|cool.|S|s|ba
me022|what is|D|qw|qw
me028|they sort of look like this.|S|s|s
me011|oh.|S|s|bk
me022|what does that mean?|Q|qw|rt
me025|that's the that's british for speed bump.|S|s|s
me022|is it a speed bump?|Q|qy|rt
me028|so that the wires go through here.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh is that right?|Q|qy|bh
me022|wow!|S|s|ba
fe008|i never heard that.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|uh.|S|s|bk
me028|so|F|fg|fg
me011|that's really cruel.|S|s|ba
me011|okay.|F|fg|fg
me011|so that|D|s|s
me028|so it would basically go on the diagonal here.|S|s|s
me022|it could go either way.|S|s|s
me011|so why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number?|Q|qw|rt
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me022|i guess.|S|s|s
me028|uh because the|D|h|h
me025|how else are you going to distribute them around the tables?|Q|qh|qh
me028|because they're there.|S|s|s
me011|well okay.|S|h|h
me011|let me rephrase that.|S|s|co
me011|why two each?|Q|qw|qw
me025|oh because then you don't have to just have one each.|S|s|s
me025|so that if if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box.|S|s|df
me028|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|and to see this is really the way people sit on this table.|S|s|s
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|uh|F|fh|fh
me028|dot dot dot.|S|s|s
fe008|which means two at each station.|S|s|s
me028|well that that's the way people sit.|S|s|nd
me028|that's how many chairs are in the room.|S|s|df
fe008|yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|yeah i'm just saying that for the recording.|S|s|bk
me011|all right.|S|s|bk
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me011|right.|B|b|b
me011|okay.|B|b|b
me028|and certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in.|S|s|cs
me028|uh if if you if you had nothing else.|S|s|e
me011|but then none of these.|S|s|s
me011|right.|B|b|b
me011|none of these and no p.z.m.'s then.|S|s|s
me028|yeah.|F|fh|fh
me028|right.|S|s|aa
me028|right.|S|s|aa
me028|i agree.|S|s|aa
me025|only if you had|D|s|s
me025|well it depends on this box right?|S|s|s
me028|oh true enough.|S|s|na
me028|and actually at the my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box.|S|s|s
me025|exactly.|S|s|aa
me028|this this box|D|s|s
me011|oh i didn't understand.|S|s|bk
fe008|that being the wiring box.|S|s|s
me028|this box is a one off deal.|S|s|s
me011|oh i see.|S|s|bk
me011|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|uh|F|fh|fh
me028|and uh it's function is to to uh essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires.|S|fh|fh
me028|plus supply power to the microphones.|S|s|e
me028|because the the the uh cheap head mounteds all require low voltage.|S|s|df
me011|so so you'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each of these two and each of those one or what?|Q|fg|fg
me028|well i|D|%|%
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me028|the simplest thing i could imagine which is really really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in.|S|s|s
me028|and there's a there's a plug on the end of each of these these uh eight cables.|S|s|s
fe008|what|D|%|%
fe008|okay.|B|b|b
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|each of the blue wires.|S|s|2
me025|but there are only four.|S|s|s
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|and there's only there's only four slots that are you know in in the first version or the version we're planning to to build.|S|s|na
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|so that that was the whole issue with the l.e.d.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|that you plug it in the l.e.d. comes on and and and you're live.|S|s|df
me011|oh then it comes on.|S|s|bk
me011|i see i see.|S|s|bk
me011|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|good.|S|s|ba
me028|now the the the subtle issue here is that i i haven't really figured out a solution for this.|S|s|s
me028|so it'll have to be convention.|S|s|s
me028|what happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else?|Q|qw|qw
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me028|well the there's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you're really not being powered.|S|fh|fh
me028|so|F|fh|fh
me028|there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people uh rewire things.|S|s|s
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me028|but|F|fh|fh
me025|yeah i mean we i had that last time.|S|s|bk
me025|but uh there are actually that you know there's an extra there's a mix out on the radio receiver?|Q|qy|d
me028|uhhuh.|S|s|aa
me025|so there are actually six x.l.r. outs on the back of the radio receiver.|S|s|s
me025|and only five cables going in.|S|s|s
me025|i had the wrong five.|S|s|s
me025|so i ended up not recording one of the channels and recording the mix.|S|s|s
me028|how interesting.|S|s|ba
me028|did you do any recognition on the mix mix out?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me028|wonder whether it works any|D|s|s
me025|but i subtracted the four that i did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the.|S|s|s
me028|got the fifth?|Q|qy|bu
me011|you|D|%|%
fe008|oh how great.|S|s|ba
me028|cool!|S|s|ba
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|and did it work?|Q|qy|rt
me028|is it is|D|%|%
me011|did it sound good?|Q|qy|rt
me025|it's not bad.|S|s|na
me025|it's not bad.|S|s|na
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me028|ain't science wonderful?|Q|qh|ba
me011|wow.|S|s|ba
fe008|that's amazing.|S|s|ba
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|so|F|fg|fg
me011|so what's the schedule on these things?|Q|qw|rt
fe008|wow.|S|s|ba
me025|but you always|D|s|s
me028|uh|F|h|h
me028|well i was wrestling with with literally the number of connectors in the cable and the the uh powering system.|S|s|s
me028|and i i was going to do this very clever phantom power.|S|s|s
me028|and i decided a couple days ago not to do it.|S|s|s
me025|huh.|B|b|b
me028|so i'm ready to build it.|S|s|s
me028|which is to say uh the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|so i think the other thing i'd like to do is do something about the set up.|S|s|cs
me011|so that it's a little more presentable and organized.|S|s|df
me028|i agree.|S|s|aa
me011|and i'm i'm just not sure what that is.|S|s|no
me011|i mean some sort of cabinet.|S|s|e
me028|well i can build a cabinet.|S|s|s
me028|the the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me028|in other words to figure out exactly what the right thing is.|S|s|df
me028|that cabinet can can go away.|S|s|s
me028|we can use that for for uh kindling or something.|S|s|cs
me028|but if you can imagine what the right form factor is|D|s|s
me028|dan and i have sort of gone around on this and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top to allow access to the mixer for example.|S|s|s
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|but there's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain.|S|s|s
me028|so you end up with this thing that|D|s|s
me028|if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened it'd be it'd be fine.|S|s|e
me028|you wouldn't necessarily|D|s|s
me028|well.|F|fh|fh
me028|you understand what i'm|D|qy|d
me028|the the you can you can start start sketching it out.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|yeah i understand.|S|s|aa
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me028|and i can certainly build it out of oak.|S|s|cc
me028|no problem.|S|s|df
me028|would it you know you know arbitrarily amount of|D|s|s
me011|i need a desk at home too all right?|S|s|j
me011|is that going to be a better solution than just going out and buy one?|Q|qy|rt
me028|well the as we found out with the the thing that uh jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system the stuff you buy is total crap.|S|h|h
me028|and i mean this is something you buy.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me028|and and|F|fh|fh
me011|and it's total crap.|S|s|ba
me028|it's total crap.|S|s|bk
me028|well it's useless for this function.|S|s|aap
me028|works fine for holding a kleenex.|S|s|aap
me028|but it|D|%|%
me011|right.|S|s|aa
me011|kleenex and telephones.|S|s|s
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me011|um|F|fg|fg
me011|so yeah i i guess it's just a question is that something you want to spend your time on.|S|fg|fg
me028|oh.|S|s|bk
me028|i i'm paid for.|S|s|s
me011|okay great.|S|s|bk
me028|i have no problem.|S|s|na
me028|no but certainly one of the issues is is the uh is security.|S|fg|fg
me011|huh.|B|b|b
me028|i mean we've been been been lax and lucky.|S|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|lax.|S|s|2
me025|yep.|B|b|b
me028|really lucky with these things.|S|s|e
me028|but they're not ours.|S|s|s
me028|so|F|fh|fh
me028|the uh the flat panels.|S|s|e
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|oh yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|i'm telling you i'm just going to cart one of them away if they stay there much longer.|S|s|cc
fe008|wow.|S|s|ba
me028|uh let the record show at uh at four thirty five adam janin says|D|s|co
me025|well yeah exactly.|S|s|aa
fe008|tempting.|S|s|ba
fe008|tempting.|S|s|ba
me025|we'll know we'll know to come after.|S|s|j
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|so um|F|fg|fg
me011|uh|F|fh|fh
me011|then the other question is do we want to try to do a user interface that's available out here.|S|s|t
me025|sorry?|Q|qw|br
fe008|user interface|D|s|s
me028|slipped almost slipped it by dan.|S|s|s
me011|a user interface.|S|s|s
me011|i mean do we want to try to get a monitor?|Q|qy|rt
me025|oh!|S|s|bk
me011|or just something.|S|s|e
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
me025|sure.|S|s|aa
me025|well of course we do.|S|s|na
me011|and how do we want to do that?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|you mean like see see meter readings from while sitting here?|Q|qy|bu
me011|just so we see something.|S|s|aap
fe008|wow.|S|s|ba
me028|how about use the thing that um aciri's doing?|Q|qh|cs
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|which is to say just laptop with a wireless.|S|s|e
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
me025|sure.|S|s|aa
me025|which we'll borrow from them when we need it.|S|s|s
me028|what's wrong with yours?|Q|qw|rt
me028|if we bought you a a|D|s|df
me025|oh applecard.|S|s|bk
me025|sure.|S|s|aa
me025|right.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah you could use my machine.|S|s|aa
me022|well|F|fg|fg
me028|what?|Q|qw|br
me011|i have an i. ram machine i've borrowed and we can use it.|S|s|cs
me025|i or the|D|%|%
me028|no.|S|s|ar
me028|i'm i'm i'm serious.|S|s|s
me028|does does the wireless thing work on your|D|qy|qy
me011|wait isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone?|Q|fg|fg
me025|uh that's an ethernet connection.|S|fh|fh
me011|well.|F|fg|fg
me028|yeah no no i'm i i i ain't joking here.|S|fg|fg
me025|it's going next door.|S|s|e
me011|we|D|%|%
me028|i'm serious that that it it|D|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|no no.|S|s|bk
me025|absolutely that's the right way to do it.|S|s|na
me025|to have it uh just|D|s|df
me028|it's very convenient especially if dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and and look in the thing every so often.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|but just have the|D|s|s
me025|and given given that we've got a wireless that we've got a we got the field.|S|s|s
me028|it's right there.|S|s|s
me025|right.|S|s|bk
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|the antenna's right there.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|right.|B|b|b
me028|right outside the|D|s|df
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|i don't know.|S|s|no
me028|i mean we need obviously need to clear this with aciri.|S|s|s
me028|but uh|F|fh|fh
me028|how tough can that be?|Q|qw|rt
me028|there it you'd all you need's web access isn't it?|S|s|bu
me025|we don't need x. access.|S|s|nd
me028|in in theory.|S|s|e
me025|but i mean that's fine.|S|s|na
me025|that's that's what it does.|S|s|s
me028|okay.|S|s|bk
me028|great.|S|s|ba
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|great.|S|s|ba
me025|so|F|fg|fg
me011|um|F|fg|fg
me011|right so it's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem.|S|s|bk
me025|with a with a with a|D|s|2
me028|no.|S|s|ar
me028|and he he had|D|s|s
me028|my my proposal is you have a laptop.|S|s|s
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me028|you don't?|Q|qy|d
me025|yeah.|S|s|ar
me025|i do.|S|s|nd
me025|yeah.|S|s|ar
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|ar
me028|if if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with the the|D|qy|cs
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me025|i would love to.|S|s|nd
me025|but i'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave lan thing they're using.|S|s|df
me028|really?|Q|qy|bh
me011|to mac.|S|s|s
me028|your new one?|Q|qy|d
me025|well apple has their own thing right?|S|s|s
me022|he's|D|%|%
me028|i'm sorry?|Q|qw|br
me011|airport.|S|s|s
me025|apple has their own thing.|S|s|s
me025|and|F|fh|fh
me028|i thought it just came through a serial or an ethernet port.|S|s|bu
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|i think what|D|s|s
me025|i think you i think it just plugs in a p.c. card.|S|s|s
me025|so you could probably make it run with that.|S|s|s
me025|but|F|fh|fh
me011|the question is is there an apple driver.|S|s|s
me028|i|F|fg|fg
me025|yeah i'm sure.|S|s|na
me025|i imagine there is.|S|s|na
me025|but anyway.|F|fg|fg
me028|but the two|D|s|s
me025|there are there are there are a bunch of machines at icsi that have those cards.|S|s|s
me025|and so i think if if it doesn't we should be able to find a machine that does that.|S|s|s
me025|i i mean i know that|D|s|s
me025|doesn't don't don't the important people have those little blue vaios that|D|qy|qy
me028|well uh that to me that's a whole nother that's a whole nother issue.|S|fg|fg
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
fe008|huh.|B|b|b
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|the the idea of convincing them that we should use their network is fairly straight forward.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me028|the idea of being able to walk into their office and say oh can i borrow your machine for a while is is is a non starter.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me028|that i i don't think that's going to work.|S|s|nd
me025|i see.|S|s|bk
me028|so i mean either either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already in the group already owns and the idea is that if it's it perk you know it's an advantage not not a or else we we literally buy a machine exactly for that purpose.|S|s|cs
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|absolutely.|S|s|aa
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me028|certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time.|S|s|df
me028|i i i i'm i'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|right.|S|s|bk
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way.|S|s|e
me011|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|and and a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are going to walk up to it and go how come i can't get you know pong on this or|D|s|df
me011|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me011|right.|B|b|b
me022|well|D|%|%
me011|i've i've borrowed the i. ram vaio sony thingy.|S|s|s
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|and i don't think they're ever going to want it back.|S|s|ba
me025|you're kidding?|Q|qy|bh
me028|well the next conference they will.|S|fh|fh
me011|so|F|fh|fh
me011|sure.|S|s|aa
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|but that does mean so we can use that as well.|S|s|ng
me028|well uh the certainly you should give it a shot first see whether you can get compatible stuff.|S|fg|fg
me025|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me028|uh ask them what it costs.|S|s|cs
me028|ask them if they have an extra one.|S|s|cs
me028|who knows they might have an extra hardware|D|s|s
me025|i'd trade them a flat panel display for it.|S|s|j
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|good.|S|s|ba
me022|what is the um projector supposed to be hooked up to?|Q|qw|qw
me028|uh the uh tsk|D|h|h
me028|it's going to be hooked up to all sorts of junk.|S|s|s
me028|there's going to be actually a a plug at the front that'll connect to people's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in.|S|s|df
me028|and it's going to be connected to the machine at the back.|S|s|df
me028|so we certainly could use that as as a constant reminder of what the v.u. meters are doing.|S|s|s
me025|huge v.u. meters.|S|s|s
me028|so people sitting here are going testing one two three.|S|s|e
me028|it|D|%|%
me022|but i mean that's another that's another possibility that you know solves|D|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me028|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|that's an|D|s|s
me028|but but but i think the idea of having a control panel it's that's there in front of you is really cool.|S|s|ba
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me025|yeah yeah.|B|b|b
fe008|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|i think and uh having having it on wireless is is the neatest way neatest way to do it.|S|s|cs
me028|as long as you as as long as you're not tempted to sit there and keep fiddling with the volume controls going can you talk a bit louder.|S|s|aap
me011|i had|D|s|s
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me011|i had actually earlier asked if i could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff.|S|s|s
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|and they said sure.|S|s|s
me011|whenever you want.|S|s|s
me011|so i think it won't be a problem.|S|fh|fh
me025|oh cool.|S|s|ba
me028|and and it's a a p.c.m.c.i.a. card right?|S|s|bu
me025|okay.|B|b|b
me011|yep.|S|s|aa
me028|p.c. card.|S|s|bk
me028|so you can have a slot.|S|s|bu
me011|p.c. card.|S|s|na
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|in your new machine.|S|s|e
me025|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|is it with|D|qy|qy
me022|it's it really come down to the driver.|S|s|s
me022|i mean|F|fh|fh
me025|yeah.|B|b|b
me028|right?|Q|qy|d
me028|it'll it'll work|D|s|s
me011|right i mean and if and if his doesn't work as i said we can use the p.c.|S|s|cs
me028|it'll work the first time.|S|s|s
me028|i i trust steve jobs.|S|s|s
me011|good.|S|s|ba
me025|um|F|fg|fg
me025|well that sounds like a good solution one way or the other.|S|fh|fh
me011|so|F|fg|fg
me011|so jim is going to be doing wiring and you're going to give some thought to cabinets?|Q|qy|bu
me028|uh yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|we we need to figure out what we want.|S|s|s
me011|great.|S|s|ba
me028|uh|D|%|%
me025|we'd i think|D|%|%
me028|hey what are those green lights doing?|Q|qw|qw
me011|they're flashing!|S|s|fe
me025|uhoh!|S|s|ba
me025|uhoh!|S|s|ba
me025|does that it means it means it's going to explode.|S|s|bu
me025|no.|S|s|ar
me028|cut the red wire!|S|s|co
me028|the red wire!|S|s|fe
me025|um|F|fg|fg
me011|when people talk it they go on and off.|S|s|s
me025|this|D|%|%
me025|so again washington wants to equip a system.|S|s|bs
me025|our system we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the p.c.|S|s|bs
me025|however seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes.|S|s|bs
me028|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
me025|uh|F|fh|fh
me025|using using these|D|s|s
me028|and it and the the five thousand for the wires.|S|s|j
me028|so if i'm going to do|D|s|s
me028|no.|D|%|%
me028|it's a joke.|S|s|df
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|i have to do|D|s|s
me025|that's true.|S|s|aa
me025|but we haven't spent that right?|S|s|s
me025|but once we once we've done the intellectual part of these uh we can just knock them out right?|S|s|s
me011|cheap.|S|s|s
me025|we can start we you can make a hundred of them or something.|S|s|cs
me028|oh of the of the boards?|S|s|bk
me028|yeah yeah.|S|s|aa
me028|sure.|S|s|aa
me028|right.|S|s|aa
me025|and then we could|D|s|cs
me025|washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what's based on these.|S|s|s
me028|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me025|and it would cost|D|s|s
me028|peanuts.|S|s|2
me011|a p.c. and a peanuts.|S|s|2
me025|p.c. and two thousand dollars for the a. to d. stuff.|S|s|e
me011|yeah.|S|s|aa
me025|and that's about because you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the|D|s|df
me028|right.|B|b|b
me025|oh the p.z.m.'s.|S|s|bk
me025|p.z.m.'s cost a lot.|S|s|s
me025|but anyway you'd save on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system.|S|s|s
me025|so actually that might be attractive.|S|s|s
me028|right.|S|s|bk
me025|okay.|S|s|bk
me011|good.|S|s|ba
me025|i can move my thumb now.|S|s|s
fe008|that's a great idea.|S|s|ba
me028|what?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|it's nice it's nice to be thinking toward that.|S|s|ba
me028|oh i thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer.|S|s|s
me011|well actually shorten|D|s|nd
me025|yeah.|S|s|aa
me011|there's a speech compression program that works great on things like this.|S|s|s
me011|because if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits.|S|s|df
me011|and so most of the time no one's talking.|S|s|e
me011|so it shortens it dramatically.|S|s|e
me011|but if you talk quieter the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better.|S|s|e
me025|yeah.|S|s|bk
me011|so|F|fh|fh
fe008|oh.|S|s|bk
fe008|huh.|S|s|bk
me028|it also helps if you talk in a monotone.|S|s|j
me011|probably.|S|s|am
me028|constant volume all the time.|S|s|e
fe008|oh interesting.|S|s|ba
fe008|and shorter words.|S|s|s
me011|shorter words.|S|s|m
me022|now shorter words wouldn't would induce more dynamics.|S|s|bu
me022|right?|Q|qy|d
me022|you want to have|D|s|s
me025|yeah but if the words are more predictable.|S|s|aa
me011|how about if you just go uh?|Q|qw|qw
me022|huh.|B|b|b
me028|uh.|S|s|m
fe008|that's a long word.|S|s|s
me011|how do you spell that?|Q|qw|qw
fe008|i don't know.|S|s|no
me011|okay.|F|fg|fg
me011|can you do one more round of digits?|Q|qy|rt
me011|are we done talking?|Q|qy|rt
me028|well it's a choice if we get a choice let's keep talking.|S|s|nd
me028|sure.|B|b|b
me011|do we have more to talk about?|Q|qy|rt
me028|no.|S|s|ar
me028|i'm done.|S|s|nd
me022|i'm done.|S|s|nd
me011|are you done?|Q|qy|rt
fe008|i'm done.|S|s|na
me011|i'm done.|S|s|s
fe008|yeah.|S|s|aa
me022|dan isn't.|S|s|j
me022|but he's not going to say anything.|S|s|j
me028|but you you you there's a problem a structural problem with this though.|S|fg|fg
me028|you really need an incentive at the end if you're going to do digits again.|S|s|cs
me028|like you know candy bars or something.|S|s|cs
me028|or or or or a little uh you know toothbrushes like they give you at the dentist.|S|s|cs
me011|i'll i'll remember to bring m. and m. 's next time.|S|s|cc
me025|huh.|S|s|ba
fe008|or both.|S|s|s
me028|or both.|S|s|bk
